### Project Backlog
*backlog of project-level concepts which may become tactical projects to be scheduled into the workload*

auto : n8n Ops Readiness Platform project
	- an Ops Readiness platform solution.  I can see how to automate 70% of it off the cuff - using a mixture of n8n, local LLM adept at creative writing, file store, database or maybe even just spreadsheet or json files.
	- Imagine the full Ops Readiness lifecycle that ORDI executed -- Intake/Scoping, menu of servcies selection, 'project' dashboard with self-service status, way to log workshop sessions and associate deliverables (documents), mechanism to trigger some canned comms with opportunity to mod the body copy, etc etc....Wouldn't that sell??? Small/Medium business might buy that?

auto : custom job compatibility analysis model
	- LLM model dedicated to highly proficient job compatibility analysis. So easy to engage with that it's worth paying for
