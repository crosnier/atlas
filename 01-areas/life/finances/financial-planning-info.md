**Questions**

1. explain 'front loaded fees'
> A front-loaded fee is a sales charge taken out **up front** when you invest in a mutual fund — typically 3% to 5.75%. 
> For example, if you invest $10,000 into a fund with a 5% front load, only $9,500 is actually invested.
> This fee goes to the broker or advisor, not toward growing your money.
> These are often associated with Class A mutual fund shares and are avoidable with ETFs or no-load funds.


2. Interest compounds? it continuously gets reinvested back into the spread as depicted for the initial investements? 
> Yes, in these hypothetical scenarios, interest, dividends, and capital gains are assumed to be **reinvested automatically**.
> This creates **compound growth**, where new earnings are added to the principal and begin earning returns themselves.
> The line item “Reinvest” in the reports confirms this compounding reinvestment behavior.
> However, in real-world taxable accounts, you'd owe taxes on those reinvested distributions unless it's in an IRA or similar tax-deferred wrapper.


3. 'bonds via mutual funds' - if i just want 50-65% of the funds in a money market account, is this the same thing?
> No, it's not the same. A bond mutual fund (like JPM Core Bond A) invests in a mix of government, corporate, and mortgage-backed bonds with longer durations and more risk.
> A money market account or fund is **much safer**, holding ultra-short-term debt like T-bills or repurchase agreements to preserve capital and keep a stable $1 NAV.
> If your goal is 50–65% in ultra-safe, cash-like holdings, you want a **money market fund or Treasury MMF**, not a bond mutual fund.
> Bond funds can and do lose value in rising-rate environments — especially long-duration ones.

4. for what duration must each investment medium remain invested before liquidiating in order to 'profit' from it?
> The "profitable" holding period varies by investment type and market conditions, but here are general guidelines:
> 
> • **Money Market Funds**: No holding period required. They maintain a stable $1/share and pay daily interest. You can profit immediately (via yield), and withdraw anytime.
> 
> • **Bond Mutual Funds**: Ideally 3–5 years minimum. These fluctuate in value based on interest rates. Selling too early (especially in a rate-hike cycle) can lead to losses. Letting interest compound over time reduces volatility risk.
> 
> • **Individual Bonds**: Hold until maturity (e.g., 1–10 years) to guarantee return of principal + interest. Selling early exposes you to price risk.
> 
> • **Mutual Funds (Stock or Balanced)**: 5+ years is recommended. Front-loaded fees immediately reduce your initial investment, so you need time (2–3 years minimum) just to break even, and longer to profit.
> 
> • **Individual Stocks**: No set period, but highly risky short-term. You should plan for 3–7+ years to ride out volatility and realize gains unless you're trading (which carries risk and tax inefficiency).
