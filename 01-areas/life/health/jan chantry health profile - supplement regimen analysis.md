BIGGEST ASK: continue mold protocol? 
```text
My biggest ask at this point is, if you think it’s a good idea to stop my mold protocol for the next eight weeks while I am working on killing the Klebsiella bacteria. 

I have to take the mold protocol for two more straight months before re testing for mold in my body, which is why I’m asking.

I've already been on the new protocol for 5 weeks ($ 1536.21 so far) and I really need to know what to do next.  The original GPT protocol said to change products after  two weeks but Osborne protocol said to do this for ten weeks on his recommended protocol which included the herbal remedies.  I've already sent that to you for your reference as directed. .  

Alternating makes more sense to me since parasites live and die in cycles plus bacteria may become resistant after prolonged use. I've been using Uvi Ursi and Kidney tonic since January, so that's 8 months and it still isn't out of my body yet. Please help me if you can.  Its time to order more meds and I can't bring myself to spend that much money again if it's not the right thing to do. Especially after the $1000. expenditure for brakes and dehumidifier! 

I also have never heard back about obtaining Ivermectin for me.  I was supposed to be on it this whole 5 weeks for parasites and bacterial infection.  Taunia had mentioned by text over a month ago that if I needed her to help obtain it, to let her know.  Do you want me to ask for her help on getting the Ivermectin in Tennessee?  I wish it was available without prescription here but it isn't.

My main question at this point is IF I should follow the CHAT GPT suggestions starting with days 14 to 21.  They call it cycle 2. I DONT KNOW IF IT MEANS TO ADD THESE TO THE CYCLE 1 PROTOCOL OR DO IT IN PLACE OF the Cycle 1 protocol?

Can you clarify your opinion on this?

Cycle 2: Berberine HCI, 500 mg 3X a day

Oil of Oregano (emulsified)150-250 mg 2 X a day

Garlic  (Allicillin or raw aged extract) 600 mg 2 X a day

Continue use UvaUrsi but take one week off after 3 weeks.

Add Ons

D-Mannose and Cranberry PACs (i dont know whatPACs means) 36mgPACs minimum

Holy Basil (I took that for four months already and now Im out.

I'm at $1500.00 expenditure right now for products I bought,  to hopefully last 10 more days  Some bottles only last 5days per bottle with the  dose I am taking. So I will have to reorder more in several days..

  

The fact that I am starting to see a difference in ability to function and not painfully bloating, I am hesitant to stop what I am doing to move to the next phase. Wondering if I should just add the Cycle 2 recommendations on top of what I am already doing?????

  

I**m currently** **on:**

 Kidney Formula Tincture ( multiple herbs for urinary tract/kidney) 3 X a day

Uva Ursi Liquid Herbal 9000 mg a day - in three doses

Ultra Caprylic Acid 4 caps a day with food

DMannose Powder 3 X a day

Ultra Silver 3 Tablespoons a day 75 mcg pure silver each tablespoon= 225 mcg

Interfase Plus 3 caps throughout day on empty stomach ( It's called THER-BIOTIC Interfase Plus, Anti Biofilm Enzyme Combination with EDTA-recommended by GPT and Dr Osborne)

Glutathion 2 pumps twice a day

Digestive enzymes before meals

B12 lozenges-1 3X a day

NAC 900 mg caps 2 X a day

Garden of Life Probiotics Urinary Tract + 50 billion in 16 probiotic strains- 1 a day in PM

  

**ALSO Taking these bc of nutritional deficiency test results showing severe deficiencies over 125%:**

(Armour Thyroid 1 in AM due to Hashimoto's AutoImmune Disease of Thyroid)

Magnesium Glycinate 1 caps 2 X a day= 240 mg total

Ultra B5 500mg 2 X a day

CalMag 6 a day each cap 450 mg

Iodine 12,500 mcg 1 a day

L-Methionine 375 mg 2 a day

Vit D3 K2,iu Vit K 200 mcg 1 daily

B3 don't know the dose bc I changed to a glass bottle and forgot to put dosage on it.  1 X a day

Organic India Brand Joy - helps with depression-2 capd 2 X a day.  Supposed to take 3 caps 2X a day but can't afford it.  I've been on it for a year 8 months and scared to stop it bc it really helps

  

Thanks for your help Bryan.  I really have invested a great deal to try and get well and if you had not done the GPT info stuff for me to begin to implement, I would be as sick as ever.  I really appreciate you so much for helping me with this situation.  Wish I had started it six months ago and not wasted so much money on other stuff that didn't work because of the biofilm factor.  I had no idea that's why they were not all working..Now if I can just keep this up financially I may have a breakthrough in the near future.

  

I Love You Very Much,

Mom

Forgot to tell you that I am allergic to:  Matrizyme, Inositol, Branched Chain Aminos, Phosphadylserine, High Potency Quercetin.  They cause severe nausea and sickness, which is unfortunate.

**Pretty overwhelming at this point. I have spent this month $1187.37 on just the new protocol that you  helped me to determine with your research for me (Klebsiella and the other bacteria in my Urinary Tract /Bio Film**

 **Praying that it has not colonized since it's been there for at least two years since discovered. by culture. . Just learned this after re-reading for the fifth time the protocol you sent me,  that I shouldn't be taking the Interface at the same time as the antimicrobials, which is what I have been doing wrong for 7 days now. They are both to be taken on empty stomach but not together!   So I will change that..** 

**I'm wondering IF I should stop the Mold Protocol while hitting the UTI bacteria,which would eliminate Liver Detox,Alpha Lipoic Acid, and Myco Binder, and drainage,  When I asked Osborne, he said I should take them together if I could handle it, but I think I am overloading my body because I am feeling completely wiped out 24/7  Your thoughts please? Its time for me to stock my weeks supply of pills in my container and I need to know what I should do...?** 

**I already sent you my portal information that shows all my test results and prescribed protocols by Dr. Osborn.  They are listed by date which is helpful**
