Note to Jeff Gould

Hello Jeff,

At the time of my initial communication I was in a state of scrambled discovery, trying to figure out the basics of how to market myself. I’ve refined both my resume and derived a list of jobs I’m currently attempting to target. 

I’m including the following content:
- Resume: latest is attached
- ‘About Me Summary’: a punchy headline for cold communications with my network contacts. Work in progress based on live feedback.
- ‘Headline’: a brief reference to the type of work I’m targeting. 
- Targeted Job Titles:  the list of job titles I’ve been finding align best with what I’ve been looking for, but this continues to be a struggle. Many titles are used in radically different ways - at best they’re loose indicators for search activity.

Any raw feedback, guidance, or connections would be very appreciated. I’m very analytical, conceptual, and appreciate direct interactions. Please don’t feel the need to use any disclaimers - I’ll actively consume anything and everything to determine how to leverage the info to make improvements.

Your time is valuable and I don’t take that for granted. Thank you in advance for any reactions!

**‘About Me Summary’ **
I bring 18+ years of experience translating complex technical plans into real-world operations that work for engineers, end users, and leadership alike. I thrive in strategy, program management, and systems integration—bridging the gap between ideas and execution.


**‘Headline’**
A couple versions I’ve been using…
—Universal—
I help teams turn complex technical plans into real-world processes that work for both engineers and everyday users. I’m looking for a senior role where I can connect operations and technology—ideally in strategy, program management, product, or system design.

**—Punch & Personal—**
I specialize in translating big technical ideas into practical, people-first operations that actually work in the real world. I’m looking for a role—**Senior Operations Strategist, Technical Program Manager, Project Manager, or Product Operations Manager**—where I can be that go-to bridge between strategy, systems, and the folks who use them every day.
