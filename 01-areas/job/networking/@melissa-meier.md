Meilssa's Job History - LInkedIn




## Melissa's LinkedIn Profile

### About Me

I am a reliable and focused team player that values cross-team collaboration, due diligence, and a thorough examination of the needs for each unique effort to achieve a successful outcome. I love working in environments that are fast-paced, people-oriented, and allow for curiosity, taking action, and collaboration. Efficiency gains in processes, light-bulb moments over hard-to-solve problems and getting the job done are just a few of my strengths and passions. In addition to my work in project management, and operations support, I have a strong Customer Service background and enjoy focusing on understanding the customer perspective whether that it is for internal or external customers, when finding solutions.
