linkedin recommendation from Wierz
```
Bryan Crosnier - Linked-In recommendation:

I have worked with Bryan for the last several years, and have been totally impressed by his:
Aptitude in understanding complex technical and business processes, and then translating his understanding of those processes into easily-understandable diagrams and verbiage that are consumable by a broad range of technical and non-technical teams
Skills in business process re-engineering and in working with multiple groups (who often have radically different goals/agendas) to find consensus in pursuing improvements to those processes
Ability to rapidly assimilate new technologies and implement prototypes and solutions based on those technologies.  His pioneering efforts have frequently provided the kickstart for system re-engineering projects.

Though he doesn‚Äôt think of himself as a ‚Äòtechnologist‚Äô or ‚Äòengineer‚Äô, he possesses many of the characteristics that are the hallmark of a good engineer: a quick and inquisitive mind, the ability to visualise and communicate his concepts/designs, an appreciation for technology and finding new ways to leverage its capabilities.  I‚Äôve enjoyed working with him and would welcome the opportunity to do so again.  

Please feel free to contact me if you need details or have further questions.
