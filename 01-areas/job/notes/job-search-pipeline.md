README generation prompt

Generate a README document framework for documenting my 'Job Search Pipeline' project.  Interrogate me, asking very productive and directionally accurate and helpful questions based on the time of my goals outlined below. THEN, based on my responses, create the readme contents accordingly. 

Be sure to use my own conversational tone, be very concise, grammatically structure it as though I'm posting it to a blog. In should be very easy for others to read. 

I want to VERY simply make note of the phases, realistic and concise attributes of each phase. I'm thinking about this project

Also generate a very concise summary for each phase based on the provided bullets. I'm having trouble summarizing it for myself.

Phase 1 - Scrappy Manual
{insert summary}
- exploratory manual searches of LinkedIn, Indeed, adhoc company sites.
- visually assess each individual job listing for basic viability
- for potentially viable listings, manualy copy/paste crticial listing details into markdown note.
	- company
	- title
	- salary (if available)
	- job description
	- link
- run 'job compatibility analysis' in pre-configured AI LLM (using prompt). include:
	- company
	- job title
	- salary (if available, if not, ask LLM for estimated range)
	- job description
- copy 'job compatibilty analysis' output to job listing markdown note:
	- 'job compatibilty analysis summary'
	- compatibilty score, enter into frontmatter
- application decision - does score + compatibiltiiy analysis content + company meets criteria? If yes=apply, if no=discard


Phase 1b - Simplified Markdown Note Data + Watchlist Index
everything in Phase 1, with the following changes
- Watchlist markdown note 


```





1. get past freaking mental block on resume content
2. complete phase 2 of my 'job search pipeline'  (I'm half way through my 'phase 2 'ai-augmented manual process' increasing efficiency a lot)
3. submit 20-35 apps, ideally 30% in salary range / 70% anything goes
4. process job search intel backlog -- sitting on 6 messages/emails with more sites and companies to integrate into my 'watchlist'
5. get LLC set up + logo + determine if trademark is appropriate/necessary
6. set up 'vibe coding'  workflow to speed things up on developing my app - i'm moving too slow - it's pissing me off that i'm aiming for too high quality.
