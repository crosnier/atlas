_Requirements Engineering / Agile IT_

**COMPATIBILITY DETAIL**
You have an **85% compatibility** score for this role. Your background in process evaluation, enterprise system integration, cross-functional collaboration, and operations strategy fits closely with the requirements engineering responsibilities. Your experience documenting workflows, managing ISO/SOX audits, supporting compliance, and designing lifecycle processes mirrors many of the expectations around requirements traceability, stakeholder engagement, and system readiness. Your Agile exposure and Salesforce administration add credibility in structured system improvement. Gaps include the **Certified Scrum Master requirement** (explicitly required), direct experience with **DOORS Next Gen / ELM**, and fewer years formally under the “requirements engineer” title. Still, your adjacent experience in complex IT/system projects translates strongly.

**Expectations**
You’ll elicit and document business/technical requirements, maintain traceability across the lifecycle, and collaborate with both technical and business teams to ensure IRS IT modernization initiatives succeed.
