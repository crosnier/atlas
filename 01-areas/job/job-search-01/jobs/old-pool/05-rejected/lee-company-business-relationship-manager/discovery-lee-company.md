## Lee Company Profile Report
Strategic profile educating me on the 

### Overview of Lee Company

Founded in 1944 by Leon Lee, Lee Company is a family-owned facilities solutions and home services firm headquartered in Franklin, Tennessee ￼
. The company has grown to roughly 1,600 employees and generates around $300 million in annual revenue ￼ ￼
. Lee Company’s business spans comprehensive HVAC, plumbing, electrical, and appliance repair services for homes, as well as large-scale construction projects and facilities management for commercial, government, healthcare, and industrial clients ￼ ￼
. This breadth – handling “everything from HVAC, plumbing, electrical, and appliance repair, to huge construction projects” – has made Lee Company one of Tennessee’s largest mechanical contractors ￼ ￼
. The company remains guided by its founding family’s values and has been recognized as a Top Workplace in Tennessee multiple times for its employee-centric culture ￼ ￼.

### Employee Distribution and Locations

Lee Company employs approximately 1,546 U.S.-based staff (as of late 2021) and continues to grow toward ~1,600 employees today ￼
. The workforce is distributed across Tennessee, Alabama, and Kentucky. The Franklin, TN headquarters – a 100,000 sq. ft, four-story facility opened in 2017 in the Berry Farms development – houses the largest concentration of employees, including corporate offices and operations support ￼
. In Tennessee, Lee Company has numerous regional offices beyond Franklin, including locations in Nashville (Donelson and Bellevue), Murfreesboro, Hendersonville, Columbia, Cookeville, Clarksville, Chattanooga, and Knoxville, among others ￼ ￼
. The company has also expanded into Bowling Green, KY and Huntsville (Madison), AL to serve those markets ￼ ￼
. While Franklin HQ serves as the central hub (with several hundred employees in corporate, management, and dispatch roles), each regional office hosts field service teams and local support. Franklin’s HQ campus not only contains executive and administrative staff but also training facilities and prefab shops that support field operations statewide ￼ ￼.

### Recent Customer Contracts and Project Wins

Lee Company has a strong track record of contract wins in both commercial and residential sectors. On the commercial side, the company has recently secured high-profile construction and facilities projects across the region. For example, Lee Company provided mechanical contracting for Belmont University’s new Thomas F. Frist, Jr. College of Medicine in Nashville and an industrial project dubbed “Project Titan,” both of which earned ABC Excellence in Construction awards in 2024 ￼
. In Kentucky, Lee Company completed major projects for a metals processing plant (“Project Precious Metals”) and a First Solar manufacturing facility – again winning industry recognition for those efforts ￼
. Other notable recent projects include The Orthopedic Center, Nashville Record Pressing’s new facility, and the Murfreesboro Medical Clinic expansion, all of which were honored by Associated Builders and Contractors in 2023 ￼
. These project wins highlight Lee Company’s strengths in healthcare, industrial, and institutional construction. Lee Company often leverages initial construction contracts into broader relationships – for instance, winning long-term facility management contracts after successful construction projects ￼
. This strategy of pairing project execution with ongoing maintenance services has led to new Facility Management (FM) agreements in both the commercial and government sectors.

On the residential side, Lee Company’s growth is reflected not in single large “contracts” but in market expansion and customer accolades. The company serves tens of thousands of homeowners annually for HVAC, plumbing, and electrical needs. Its residential service excellence has been validated by community awards – in 2025 Lee Company was voted the “Best Plumbing, Best Heating & AC, and Best Electrician” company in Williamson County (via the Williamson Herald’s Sizzle Awards) ￼
. Similarly, in the Chattanooga area, Lee Company was the News 12 Viewer’s Choice winner for best electrician in 2025 ￼
. These honors demonstrate strong customer trust and brand presence in the residential market. Lee Company’s home services division continues to add new customers through its Lee Company+ membership plan (a home maintenance subscription) and through geographic expansion (e.g. opening new service locations in fast-growing communities). The combination of reliable service delivery and a reputation for integrity (underlined by a 2025 BBB Torch Award for Ethics in business) helps Lee Company consistently win residential customers ￼.

### Pipeline of Future Projects and Initiatives

Looking forward, Lee Company’s project pipeline remains robust across construction, technology integration, and internal systems improvements. The company has secured or is pursuing multiple new projects in its key domains. In the construction arena, upcoming initiatives include continued work in the healthcare sector (building on the Belmont medical school project and other hospital expansions) and large-scale industrial projects in the region. Notably, Lee Company’s recent performance on “Project Titan” and a follow-up industrial project (BG Project 2) in 2022 for a manufacturing client has solidified its reputation and is leading to design-build opportunities, where Lee Company is trusted with both design and execution ￼ ￼. Pipeline projects also span clean energy manufacturing (e.g. additional phases for clients like First Solar) and institutional developments in Middle Tennessee. Regional growth is expected as well – for instance, the North Alabama and Kentucky divisions have won awards for projects like Precious Metals and Project Titan, indicating ongoing work in those areas ￼ ￼.

In the technology integration realm, Lee Company is expanding its Smart Buildings Group to meet demand for intelligent building systems. Under the leadership of a dedicated VP of Smart Buildings, this group is poised to implement advanced controls, building automation, and IoT solutions in upcoming projects ￼. Future initiatives likely include retrofitting client facilities with smart HVAC controls, energy monitoring systems, and integrated security/automation – a growing market as commercial clients seek improved efficiency. Internally, Lee Company has a strong pipeline of systems and process improvements. The Strategic Transformation team and IT department are implementing new enterprise software to streamline operations. In 2024, Lee Company was recognized as “Most Innovative Prophix Customer of the Year” for its use of Prophix financial software ￼, highlighting an ongoing focus on data-driven planning and modernized internal platforms. Future internal projects include upgrades to the ERP and mobile field service applications, improved data analytics capabilities, and continued enhancements to the customer online portal – all ensuring the company’s systems scale with its growth. In summary, Lee Company’s future is marked by a secured backlog of construction projects (in healthcare, manufacturing, and commercial development), an emphasis on tech-enabled services (smart buildings, energy efficiency), and continuous internal innovation to support its expanding operations.

### Internal Organizational Structure

Lee Company’s organization is structured around key business units and corporate support functions, each with designated leadership. Below is an overview of major internal groups and their leadership:
	•	Home Services (Residential Division) – Focuses on homeowner solutions: HVAC, plumbing, electrical, home improvements, etc. This division is led by a Vice President of Home Services Operations and Support. Keith Bryan, VP of Operations for Home Services, oversees the field service teams and daily residential operations ￼. Erin Maupin, VP of Support for Home Services, manages customer support, scheduling, and the home maintenance plan program ￼. These leaders ensure residential technicians, call center staff, and support personnel deliver quality service to thousands of homes.
	•	Facilities Services & Construction (Commercial Division) – Handles large construction projects, commercial HVAC/plumbing/electrical services, and facility maintenance for business clients. This broad area is subdivided as follows: Construction Services is led by two vice presidents – Justin Braden and Brad Gipson, both Vice Presidents of Construction, who oversee project management and execution of construction contracts ￼. Facility Services (ongoing maintenance and smaller projects for facilities) is headed by Michael Harrell, VP of Facility Services ￼, who manages service crews and technicians dedicated to commercial clients. In addition, Lee Company has a specialized Facilities Management & Maintenance group branded “FM²” (FM Squared), which provides integrated facilities management solutions (outsourced building operations for clients). The FM² group is overseen by Robert Lunny, Executive VP of FM², with Steve Scott, Senior VP of Sales & Business Development (FM²) driving client relationships and new contracts ￼ ￼. This structure allows Lee Company to offer everything from one-time construction installs to full ongoing facilities management under unified leadership.
	•	Smart Buildings & Innovation – A newer team concentrating on technology integration (building automation, controls, and smart facility solutions). Caleb Lee, VP of Smart Buildings, heads this group ￼. The Smart Buildings team often works closely with both construction and facility services units to implement IoT devices, energy management systems, and cutting-edge tech in customer projects. Their placement in the org chart signals Lee Company’s strategic priority on innovation in building tech.
	•	Corporate Functions – These departments support all business units internally:
	•	People Services (Human Resources) – Led by Shelley Lambing, Senior VP of People Services ￼. This team manages recruitment, training, benefits, and employee engagement, reflecting the company’s focus on being a top workplace.
	•	Finance and Accounting – Led by Rob Ivy, Chief Financial Officer, with support from Lauren Painter, VP of Finance ￼ ￼. They handle financial strategy, budgeting, accounting, and also likely oversee procurement. Under CFO oversight, the finance team ensures profitable growth and oversees investments in capital and technology.
	•	Information Technology (IT) – Led by Tom Goddard, VP of Information Technology ￼. The IT group manages Lee Company’s internal systems (ERP, dispatch software, customer portal, etc.), cybersecurity, and technological infrastructure. They also support the implementation of new software (often in partnership with the Strategic Transformation team).
	•	Safety and Quality – (Though not explicitly listed in the leadership page, safety is core to operations, evidenced by ABC Safety awards). Likely managed under Operations or HR with dedicated safety managers ensuring jobsite safety compliance and training.
	•	Community Relations & Marketing – Gerald R. Vance, Executive VP of Community Relations, leads outreach, brand and community engagement efforts ￼. This role entails public relations, charitable initiatives (like Lee Company’s community service programs), and maintaining the company’s positive public image. (Lee Company’s marketing functions are not detailed on the site, but community relations suggests a focus on local community ties and brand reputation, an area Mr. Vance has overseen for decades).
	•	Executive Leadership and Strategy – At the top, Richard C. Perko, President & CEO, guides overall company strategy and operations ￼. He works closely with the executive team (CFO, EVPs, SVPs) to set vision and ensure all divisions meet their goals. Additionally, Lee Company’s Strategic Transformation office (discussed later in Christy Wyse’s profile) is part of the internal structure, driving cross-departmental improvements and innovation.

This organizational setup allows Lee Company to operate a matrix of service lines (home services, facilities, construction) supported by strong centralized functions (HR, IT, Finance). Many of the senior leaders have decades of tenure – for example, EVP of Service Dan Kalman (40+ years) oversees service delivery strategy ￼, and EVP of Operations Stuart Price (25+ years) coordinates operations across departments ￼. This depth of experience in leadership ensures each department is well-aligned with the company’s mission of “making life better” for customers and employees ￼.

### External Service Lines and Customer-Facing Structure

Externally, Lee Company presents its services in two primary divisions to align with customer needs:
	•	“My Home” – Residential Services:  This encompasses all home maintenance and improvement offerings. Under the Lee Company Home Services umbrella, residential customers can access HVAC repair and installation, plumbing services, electrical repairs, appliance repair, home improvements, and handyman services ￼. Lee Company markets these as an integrated solution for homeowners – effectively a one-stop shop for all home systems needs. The company also offers the Lee Company+ Home Maintenance Plan, a membership that provides homeowners with scheduled annual inspections (for HVAC, plumbing, electrical systems), priority scheduling, discounted repairs, and other perks ￼. By bundling services and offering preventative maintenance through Lee Company+, the firm strengthens its residential customer relationships. The branding of “My Home” on the website reflects a customer-centric approach, making it easy for a homeowner to find relevant services for any issue in their house.
	•	“My Facility” – Commercial/Facility Services:  This side of the business caters to commercial, industrial, and institutional clients. Lee Company offers comprehensive facilities solutions, including: Construction (design-build and mechanical contracting for new buildings or renovations), HVAC, Plumbing & Electrical Services for facilities (equipment installations, retrofits, and repairs), General Maintenance for commercial buildings, and Facilities Management (FM²) which is a full-service outsourcing of building operations and maintenance ￼ ￼. Additionally, the Smart Buildings Group falls under facility services, providing advanced controls and integration for “intelligent” facilities ￼. Lee Company’s external structure highlights these offerings separately so business clients can see tailored solutions. The company emphasizes being a single-source partner for facilities: it can build a state-of-the-art facility and then service it for years afterward. On its website and marketing, Lee Company showcases case studies and a portfolio of commercial projects ￼, signaling expertise in sectors like healthcare, education, manufacturing, government, and more. By splitting outward branding into Home vs. Facilities divisions, Lee Company speaks directly to the distinct needs of homeowners versus facility managers, while internally leveraging synergies between the two sides (for example, shared support services and combined purchasing power). This dual structure is a competitive advantage, as few regional firms offer such a broad spectrum of services under one roof ￼.

### Employee Personas by Department

Lee Company’s workforce spans a variety of roles, from field technicians on job sites to analysts at headquarters. Below are typical employee personas for key groups:

Lee Company team members, including field technicians and corporate staff.
	•	Field Technicians (HVAC, Plumbing, Electrical Techs): These employees are the front-line service providers, visiting homes or facilities to perform maintenance, repairs, and installations. A Lee Company HVAC technician’s day might include driving a company van to scheduled customer appointments, diagnosing a cooling issue, replacing a part on an AC unit, and ensuring the customer is informed and satisfied. Field techs are typically licensed or certified in their trade and receive ongoing training. They use mobile apps or tablets (provided by Lee Company) to track work orders and enter service notes. A strong safety culture means techs perform jobsite safety checks and follow protocols (Lee Company has won safety awards for its low incident rates ￼). Persona: For example, “Jordan” is a Lee Company HVAC Technician with 5 years of experience. He starts his day at the regional office, reviews his work orders on a tablet, then heads out to customers’ homes for tune-ups or urgent repairs. Jordan prides himself on professionalism – wearing the Lee Company uniform, explaining repairs to homeowners in plain language, and working efficiently. He may handle 5–6 service calls in a day. Between calls, he updates the dispatch system and communicates with his supervisor if any complex issues arise. At day’s end, he restocks his van and checks the next day’s schedule. Field technicians like Jordan are the face of Lee Company to residential and commercial customers, and they benefit from a support network (dispatchers, parts suppliers, technical supervisors) that HQ provides. Average pay for an experienced HVAC tech is about $25–$27 per hour (around $55,000/year) ￼, with opportunities for overtime and bonuses based on performance.
	•	Project Managers (Construction and Special Projects): Project Managers at Lee Company handle the planning and execution of large installation projects. They work in the Construction division or in Special Projects teams (which tackle unique or accelerated jobs). A project manager’s role involves coordinating between the client, internal engineers/designers, field crews, and subcontractors. Persona: “Alex” is a Senior Project Manager overseeing a hospital HVAC retrofit project. She starts her morning at the Franklin HQ, meeting with the engineering team to review updated mechanical drawings. Later she drives to the job site to walk through progress with the site superintendent and safety coordinator. Alex checks that the crew has the needed materials (perhaps many were prefabbed at Lee Company’s shop) and that the project is on schedule. She spends the afternoon back at the office updating the project timeline, adjusting budgets, and emailing the client a status report. Project managers like Alex are skilled at multitasking – handling budgets, technical issues, and client expectations. They often hold professional certifications (e.g. PMP or trade licenses) and bring years of field experience. Compensation: A Lee Company Project Manager may earn roughly $70k–$90k per year (depending on experience and project size), aligning with industry standards for construction management in the region.
	•	IT Staff and Business Analysts: Lee Company’s IT team and analysts are primarily based at the Franklin headquarters, working behind the scenes to keep systems running and to implement new solutions. Persona: “Taylor” is an IT Business Analyst in the Strategic Transformation office. Her day might begin with a meeting with the Home Services department managers to gather requirements for a new scheduling software feature – she listens to their needs (e.g. more efficient technician routing) and documents specifications. Midday, Taylor collaborates with a software vendor or the internal development team to translate those requirements into a design. In the afternoon, she might train a group of field supervisors on how to use a new mobile app feature or analyze data from the customer portal to identify user experience improvements. IT staffers like Taylor require both technical knowledge and a deep understanding of Lee Company’s business processes. They serve as bridges between business units and technology – a role very much aligned with Business Relationship Management. On the more technical side, Lee Company also has system administrators and developers: e.g., network engineers maintaining the infrastructure, or database analysts managing the service data for thousands of work orders. Compensation: IT roles at Lee Company are competitive with market; a mid-level Business Analyst or IT Systems Specialist might earn in the range of $70,000–$85,000 per year, whereas IT managers or senior developers can make closer to six-figure salaries, especially given the importance of technology in scaling the company. (Overall, reported salaries at Lee Company range from about $40k for entry-level roles to $160k for senior roles in sales or management ￼, indicating how IT/business analyst roles fall in the mid-to-upper part of that range.)
	•	Corporate Staff (Administrative and Support Roles): These employees work in departments such as HR, Finance, Marketing, and Customer Service. Persona: “Morgan” is an Administrative Assistant supporting the Operations and Service VPs. In a typical day, Morgan might coordinate meetings, prepare reports on service department KPIs, and assist with onboarding new managers. She fields calls, manages calendars, and ensures communication flows smoothly among the leadership team. Others in this category include customer service representatives (who handle inbound calls and scheduling for home service appointments), dispatchers (who coordinate technicians’ daily routes), accountants (managing billing, payroll, vendor payments), and HR coordinators (involved in recruiting and benefits admin). These roles demand organization and people skills, aligning with Lee Company’s culture of helpfulness. Compensation: Corporate staff salaries vary by role – for instance, an Administrative Assistant at Lee Company was reported around $67,000/year ￼, while a customer service/data entry clerk earns an hourly wage (often around $18/hr) ￼. Many corporate roles fall roughly in the $50k–$80k range, with higher figures for managers or specialists. Lee Company’s benefits (health insurance, retirement plan, etc.) are frequently praised in employee reviews, adding to the overall compensation package ￼.

These personas illustrate the day-to-day experiences of Lee Company employees across departments. Despite different daily duties, a common theme is that employees feel part of a larger mission and are given resources to succeed – whether it’s a field tech leveraging a well-stocked truck and training support, or an analyst using modern tools to drive improvements. The company’s values of safety, customer focus, and teamwork permeate all these roles, creating a relatively smooth collaboration between field and office staff to deliver “one Lee” experience to customers.

### A Day in the Life at Franklin HQ

For a Business Relationship Manager or any professional based at the Franklin headquarters, a typical day is dynamic and cross-functional. The Franklin HQ is a modern, open office environment that facilitates interaction among different departments (the building even features a central “floating” staircase and ample collaboration spaces to encourage movement and teamwork ￼). Here’s what a day in the life might look like for an HQ employee:
	•	Morning: Employees arrive at the Berry Farms headquarters by 8:00 AM, grabbing coffee in the communal kitchen or at a nearby cafe. The day often starts with a team huddle or staff meeting. For example, the BRM (Business Relationship Manager) might meet with the Home Services leadership to review any IT or process issues impacting field operations. Simultaneously, in another conference room, project managers could be meeting with construction supervisors to go over project updates. The open floor plan means one might see the CFO chatting with HR about staffing needs, or the CEO, Richard Perko, walking around greeting teams – a reflection of the approachable culture. After the meeting, the BRM spends time at her desk analyzing feedback from department heads and prioritizing requests for the IT team.
	•	Midday: Lunchtime is flexible – many HQ employees head out to one of the new restaurants in the Berry Farms complex or have lunch-and-learn sessions. Lee Company often hosts training workshops at HQ, so a midday might involve attending a brief session on a new software rollout or a safety update. For instance, as a BRM, you might join a demo led by the Strategic Transformation team on a prototype of a new customer scheduling system, along with stakeholders from Service and IT. This collaborative vibe is common; departments mix freely. It’s not unusual to find a field technician or branch manager visiting HQ – picking up supplies or attending a meeting – which adds practical perspective to office discussions. You might eat lunch in the break area while casually conversing with a field operations manager about how a recent tech change impacted technicians – exactly the kind of insight a BRM relays to the IT developers.
	•	Afternoon: The BRM’s afternoon could be filled with cross-departmental work. Perhaps you join a conference call with the Smart Buildings Group and a hospital client to align on technology requirements for an upcoming project – acting as the liaison translating client needs to internal tech capabilities. Later, you might work on documentation for an internal project, like defining business requirements for an ERP upgrade, working closely with Christy Wyse’s Strategic Transformation team. Headquarters employees often have schedules packed with meetings, but Lee Company tries to balance this with focus time. You might have a couple of hours blocked to analyze data – e.g., reviewing service department performance metrics or ROI calculations for a proposed project – in the quiet of your workstation or a huddle room. Throughout the afternoon, there’s plenty of interdepartmental communication: finance might ping you about budget constraints for a project, or a regional manager might call in with a request for a new report or tool. The BRM ensures such communications get to the right people (developers, analysts) and that priorities are clear.
	•	Early Evening: By 5:00–5:30 PM, many employees finish up work. A day at HQ may end with a brief wrap-up email to summarize progress on initiatives for your stakeholders. Some days, there might be an after-hours volunteer or community event – Lee Company encourages participation in programs like Vans4Cans (the annual food drive) or local charity runs ￼. An HQ employee might join colleagues in loading donation vans or attending a community networking event, reflecting the company’s community-oriented ethos. Work-life balance is valued; reviews often note the “amazing culture and approachable management” ￼. By evening, the Franklin HQ quiets down, though a 24/7 emergency service means a rotating crew in the call center will handle overnight needs for customers. For most HQ staff, the day concludes knowing that their efforts – coordinating between the field and tech, improving systems, or supporting employees – directly contributed to making life better for customers and colleagues, in line with Lee Company’s mission.

In summary, a headquarters employee’s day is a blend of meetings, collaborative problem-solving, and strategic planning, all within a collegial atmosphere. The BRM role in particular touches many of these aspects: you’d interface with every department, translating needs, building relationships, and ensuring that the “technology and business” conversation is always productive. The Franklin HQ, being the central node of all these interactions, provides a front-row seat to the company’s operations and a chance to influence Lee Company’s future direction on a daily basis.

### Revenue and Growth Trends

Lee Company’s revenue profile has shown steady growth in recent years. Annual revenue is estimated around $300 million (as of the early 2020s) ￼. This figure has likely increased with the company’s expansion and project backlog, as evidenced by its rising rank among Nashville’s largest companies. In 2023, Lee Company was ranked #21 on the Nashville Business Journal’s list of Largest Private Companies in the area ￼. (For context, this ranking is based on annual revenue; achieving #21 indicates Lee Company’s revenues are among the top tier of Middle Tennessee firms.) Just a few years prior, in 2019, Lee Company was #30 on the same list ￼ – the jump to #21 underscores significant revenue growth and scale-up in a short period. This growth has been driven by both its commercial project wins and the expansion of residential service operations.

Three-year growth rates have been strong, contributing to these rankings ￼. Lee Company’s revenue mix includes large one-time project revenues (construction contracts can be multi-million dollar each) and recurring service revenues (maintenance contracts, service calls, etc.), which provides a balanced income stream. Notably, Lee Company is also recognized nationally; in the mechanical contracting industry “Book of Giants,” it has been listed among the Top 50 contractors by revenue in the U.S. ￼. In 2019, for example, it was ranked #14 among U.S. mechanical firms by revenue and #6 among sheet metal contractors ￼ – highlighting that a Middle Tennessee firm has achieved national scale in its domain.

The revenue growth trend has been positive year-over-year, even through economic cycles. The company’s diversification (serving home and commercial markets) provides some resilience – for instance, during construction market slowdowns, the service division’s steady maintenance work provides a buffer, and vice versa. Over the past decade, internal initiatives (like improving sales effectiveness and expanding geographically) have roughly tripled the business. Indeed, competitor data (like Hiller’s, noted later) show Lee Company’s revenue is roughly 2–3 times that of typical local competitors, affirming its market leader status.

Looking forward, Lee Company’s pipeline (described earlier) suggests continued revenue growth. The focus on high-growth markets (Nashville’s construction boom, Huntsville’s tech/manufacturing growth, etc.) positions the company to capitalize on regional economic expansion. Maintaining profitability is also a priority – the CFO and finance team ensure that growth is sustainable. The company’s presence on “Fastest Growing” lists and consistent Top Workplaces awards indicate it is managing expansion in a healthy way. In summary, Lee Company is a $300M+ revenue enterprise on an upward trajectory, leveraging its broad service offerings and regional reputation to capture more market share each year. For a BRM candidate, this growth context means you’d be joining a financially strong company with resources to invest in strategic projects.

### Salary Ranges by Role/Department

Lee Company offers competitive compensation across its various departments, with pay scaled to experience and role responsibility. Below is an overview of typical salary ranges (or hourly rates) for key categories of employees:
	•	Field Staff (Technicians & Trades): Hourly wages for field technicians are in line with industry standards and local market rates. HVAC and Plumbing Technicians usually earn about $22 – $30 per hour, depending on experience and certifications. Indeed reports the average HVAC Technician pay at $26.88 per hour at Lee Company ￼, which translates to roughly $55,000 annually (not including potential overtime). Entry-level maintenance technicians might start around the lower end (e.g. ~$22/hour) ￼, while specialized or senior techs (with many years at the company and multiple licenses) could be at or above $30/hour. In addition, field staff often have access to productivity bonuses or spiffs for selling maintenance plans or accessories, and they receive benefits like company vehicles for work use.
	•	Project Managers & Supervisors: Project Managers in construction or service management roles tend to be salaried. Based on industry benchmarks and company data, a Project Manager at Lee Company can expect roughly $70,000 to $90,000 per year. More junior project engineers or assistant PMs might be in the $60k range, whereas a very senior PM managing multiple large projects could approach or exceed $100k. Indeed’s data doesn’t list PM directly, but it shows roles like Service Consultant at ~$72k ￼ and Account Manager at ~$69k ￼, implying that managerial roles cluster in the high-$60s to mid-$70s. Considering project managers carry significant responsibility for budgets and client satisfaction, their pay is set accordingly high. Field supervisors (who oversee crews but are not full PMs) likely earn in the high $20s/hour or equivalent salary (e.g. $60k+).
	•	Corporate Staff (Administrative/Clerical to Middle Management): Salaries for office staff cover a wide range. Administrative assistants or coordinators might earn from $40k to $60k annually, with variation by experience. Notably, an Administrative Assistant at Lee Company was reported to have a salary around $67,000 per year ￼ – this may reflect a senior admin with long tenure or added duties, but it shows that experienced support staff are well-compensated. Customer service representatives typically are paid hourly, often in the range of $15 – $20 per hour (so roughly $31k–$40k/year). Moving up, department analysts or specialists (e.g. a marketing specialist, HR generalist, accounting analyst) might be in the $50k – $70k range. Managers of departments (like an HR Manager, Accounting Manager, Call Center Manager) could fall between $70k and $90k depending on the scope of their team. Lee Company’s benefits (insurance, 401k with match, etc.) add significant value as well, making the overall compensation package attractive and aiding in the company’s strong retention rates.
	•	Information Technology and Technical Roles: IT professionals at Lee Company command salaries consistent with their specialized skills. A Systems or Business Analyst typically earns around $75k – $85k. A Software Developer or Systems Engineer might be in the $80k – $100k range, especially if they lead key initiatives (for instance, developing custom applications for dispatch or analytics). Indeed’s records show a wide range, with a role labeled Account Representative hitting $160k (likely a high commission-based sales role) ￼, which isn’t IT, but indicates the upper extremes for certain positions. In IT, senior roles like IT Manager or IT Director (if applicable under the VP of IT) could also approach the low six-figures given their responsibility for critical systems company-wide. Additionally, Lee Company invests in training and certifications for IT staff, which can boost their earning potential internally or in the market.
	•	Executive and Leadership Positions: The executive leadership team (discussed below) would be at the top end of the salary spectrum. While exact figures aren’t published, one can infer ranges: Vice Presidents likely earn in the low six-figures (many VPs at Lee Company have decades of experience and oversee large profit centers, so $120k+ is conceivable, plus performance bonuses). The CFO and EVPs probably earn higher, with total compensation that could include bonuses tied to company performance. For example, industry data for similarly sized firms suggests a CFO for a $300M company might earn base salary in the $200k range plus incentives. Lee Company’s culture of promoting from within and long tenure often means leadership pay grows as the company grows.

It’s worth noting that Lee Company’s compensation strategy is not just about base pay – the company prides itself on offering strong benefits and a positive work environment. The combination of fair pay, overtime opportunities for hourly workers, and benefits (health insurance, retirement, paid time off, etc.) contributes to overall job satisfaction (employees rate Lee Company 3.6/5 on pay & benefits on review sites) ￼. For a BRM candidate specifically, the salary would likely be calibrated to an IT/Business liaison manager level, which in this context would likely fall in the high-$80k to low-$100k range, commensurate with the responsibility of bridging multiple departments – though exact numbers would depend on experience and scope of the role.

### Executive Leadership Team

Lee Company’s executive leadership team is composed of seasoned professionals, many of whom have been with the company for decades. They guide the organization’s strategy and oversee their respective divisions. Below is a summary of the key leaders, their titles, and the internal groups they manage:
	•	Richard C. Perko – President & CEO: Richard Perko leads Lee Company from the top, having risen through the ranks (he has 35+ years in the industry) ￼. As CEO, he sets overall strategy, champions the company culture, and often serves as the public face of Lee Company. He works closely with all divisions and particularly focuses on major strategic initiatives and maintaining the family legacy ethos. Perko’s leadership has overseen the company’s growth into new markets and its technological evolution. (Notably, Richard Perko succeeded Bill Lee – the founder’s grandson – as CEO when Bill Lee entered public service; the Lee family remains involved at the Board level, keeping the company’s ownership and values rooted in its founding family.)
	•	Rob Ivy – Chief Financial Officer (CFO): Rob Ivy manages Lee Company’s financial health, including accounting, financial planning, and risk management ￼. With a decade in the industry, Ivy ensures that growth is profitable and sustainable. He oversees the Finance and Accounting teams (including the VP of Finance, Lauren Painter ￼) and likely also has oversight of IT budgeting and strategic investments. Under Ivy’s financial stewardship, Lee Company has achieved the revenue growth and stability noted in company accolades. His role also involves reporting financial performance to the owners/Board and guiding decisions on major capital expenditures (like facility expansions or acquisitions).
	•	Gerald R. Vance – Executive Vice President of Community Relations: Gerald “Jerry” Vance has one of the longest tenures (39+ years) ￼. He leads community relations, which encompasses marketing, public relations, and the company’s extensive community service initiatives. Vance’s team manages Lee Company’s brand presence (e.g., communications, sponsorships, media relations) and internal communications. Given Lee Company’s emphasis on being a local trusted partner, Vance’s role in nurturing community trust (through ethical business practices, outreach, charitable events) is crucial. He often represents Lee Company in industry associations and community boards as well.
	•	Dan Kalman – Executive Vice President of Service: Dan Kalman oversees the entire service division (both residential and commercial service operations) ￼. With 40 years in the industry, he ensures that Lee Company’s day-to-day service calls and small projects run efficiently and meet quality standards. Operationally, the VPs of Home Services (Keith Bryan, Erin Maupin) and Facility Services (Michael Harrell) report up through Kalman, meaning he is responsible for all field technicians and service crews company-wide. Kalman focuses on service delivery excellence – things like response time, customer satisfaction, service technician training, and safety in the field fall under his purview. His leadership has been key to Lee Company’s reputation for reliable service.
	•	Stuart L. Price – Executive Vice President of Operations: Stuart Price (25+ years in the industry) ￼ has a broad operational remit. While title-wise similar to Kalman, Price likely concentrates on internal operations, process improvement, and cross-department coordination. He may drive operational efficiency programs (LEAN initiatives, etc.) and ensure that the construction and service sides are coordinated (for instance, resource planning, shared equipment, etc.). Departments like the prefabrication shop, logistics/warehouse, and safety might fall under Price’s oversight. In essence, he is charged with optimizing how Lee Company runs its projects and services from an operational standpoint, ensuring consistency and excellence across all offerings.
	•	Robert “Bob” Lunny – Executive Vice President of FM² (Facilities Management and Maintenance): Bob Lunny leads the FM² division, which provides comprehensive facilities management to external clients ￼. With 37 years of experience, Lunny has deep expertise in building maintenance and operations. He ensures that clients who outsource their facility management to Lee Company (such as managing all HVAC, electrical, plumbing, and general upkeep of a building or campus) receive high-value service. Internally, he manages the teams of facility managers, on-site technicians, and coordinators assigned to FM² contracts. Lunny also works with the sales team (notably SVP Steve Scott) to scope and secure new FM contracts. His role bridges traditional service and long-term partnership, which is a strategic growth area for Lee Company.
	•	Shelley Lambing – Senior Vice President of People Services: Shelley Lambing heads People Services, i.e., Human Resources ￼. In her 11+ years in the industry, Lambing has modernized Lee Company’s HR practices, focusing on talent development and retention. She oversees recruiting (ensuring the pipeline of skilled technicians and professionals remains strong), training programs (like apprenticeships for trades and leadership training for managers), benefits and compensation strategy, and employee relations. Lambing’s team is also behind Lee Company’s Top Workplace awards, as they implement surveys and initiatives to keep morale high ￼. Under her leadership, the company has enhanced its employer branding (so crucial in the competitive skilled trades job market) and championed diversity and inclusion efforts in a traditionally male-dominated industry.
	•	Steve Scott – Senior Vice President of Sales & Business Development (FM²): Steve Scott (31 years in industry) leads sales strategy, particularly focusing on business development for Facilities Services/FM² ￼. He and his team cultivate relationships with potential commercial and institutional clients, prepare proposals for new projects or maintenance contracts, and drive growth in the B2B segments. Given Lee Company’s breadth, Scott’s role is to communicate to prospects how the company can meet all their facility needs. He likely works closely with marketing (under Gerald Vance) and the executive team to set sales targets and identify new market opportunities (e.g., expanding further into adjacent cities or industries). His decades of experience help in understanding client pain points and tailoring solutions – which in turn influences how services are packaged and delivered.
	•	Tom Goddard – Vice President of Information Technology: Tom Goddard (40 years in industry) leads the IT department and all technology initiatives at Lee Company ￼. He is responsible for the infrastructure (networks, hardware, cybersecurity) as well as software systems (from the dispatching and CRM systems to back-office ERP and the customer web portal). Goddard’s team ensures uptime of critical systems used by technicians (like the mobile field service app) and by customers (online scheduling, etc.). He also spearheads IT projects such as new system implementations or upgrades – often in partnership with the Strategic Transformation director (Christy Wyse). A VP of IT with four decades experience is somewhat unique – it suggests Goddard has both deep technical know-how and historical knowledge of Lee Company’s evolution. Under his watch, Lee Company has embraced technology to improve efficiency (e.g., implementing field tablets, using BIM for construction, adopting analytical tools which earned that Prophix award ￼).
	•	Lauren Painter – Vice President of Finance: Lauren Painter supports the CFO by managing day-to-day financial operations ￼. With 9 years in the field, she represents a newer generation of leadership. Painter likely oversees accounting teams (accounts receivable/payable, payroll) and handles financial reporting. She may also focus on budgeting processes and financial analysis, giving department heads the data they need to manage their budgets. In essence, she is the right-hand to the CFO, ensuring financial controls and accurate books as the company grows. Her role is critical in maintaining profitability per project and per service line, as well as integrating acquisitions or new branches financially.
	•	Michael Harrell – Vice President of Facility Services: Michael Harrell (28 years experience) heads the team that executes facility service contracts and smaller commercial jobs ￼. Under the oversight of EVP Dan Kalman, Harrell’s domain includes dispatching and supervising technicians for commercial client sites, managing service level agreements for key accounts, and ensuring quality on every service call outside the residential arena. For instance, if a manufacturing plant has a maintenance contract with Lee Company, Harrell’s group makes sure technicians are scheduled for preventative maintenance, emergency calls are handled 24/7, and client communication is smooth. He works closely with FM² leadership for any overlaps. Harrell’s long tenure suggests he likely started as a field technician or project manager and now leverages that hands-on knowledge to lead the facility services department effectively.
	•	Erin Maupin – Vice President of Support, Home Services: Erin Maupin (18 years in industry) is essentially the operations manager for the Home Services division’s support functions ￼. She handles the call center, customer service, scheduling, and the administrative side of residential operations. Under her leadership, when a homeowner calls for service, the request is efficiently booked, routed, and followed-up. Maupin also likely oversees the Lee Company+ membership program logistics (ensuring all those promised annual inspections are performed timely) and coordinates marketing promotions with the community relations team for the residential audience. Her role is about enabling the field technicians to be successful by providing excellent customer coordination and behind-the-scenes support.
	•	Keith Bryan – Vice President of Operations, Home Services: Keith Bryan (31 years experience) complements Erin Maupin by directly overseeing the field operations for Home Services ￼. He manages all residential technicians and installers, sets technical training standards, and monitors performance metrics like first-time fix rate and customer satisfaction scores on home jobs. Bryan’s extensive experience, likely having come up through the HVAC trade, means he ensures that Lee Company’s residential services remain top-quality and up-to-date with the latest home technologies (from high-efficiency HVAC units to smart thermostats). He and Maupin work hand-in-hand – Bryan focusing on field workforce and technical execution, Maupin on scheduling and customer interface – to grow the home services business.
	•	Justin Braden and Brad Gipson – Vice Presidents of Construction: Justin Braden (30 years in industry) ￼ and Brad Gipson (26 years) ￼ share leadership of the Construction division. They likely split responsibilities either by type of project or by operational function. For example, one might handle pre-construction and estimating, while the other manages field construction operations; or they might each oversee different project portfolios (e.g., one focuses on healthcare and institutional projects, the other on industrial and commercial builds). Both bring decades of construction management experience. They coordinate closely with project managers, ensure projects meet budget and schedule, handle procurement for major equipment, and maintain relationships with general contractors (Turner, JE Dunn, etc. who often partner with Lee Company). Under their guidance, Lee Company’s construction arm has delivered award-winning projects (e.g., the Belmont College of Medicine, etc.) and maintained a strong safety record ￼ ￼. Their dual leadership structure suggests the volume of construction work is significant enough to require two heads, or that they focus on different geographic regions or specialties.
	•	Jake Mitchell – Vice President of Business Development: Jake Mitchell (22 years in industry) leads general Business Development across the company ￼. While Steve Scott is focused on FM² sales, Jake Mitchell likely targets a broader scope – possibly large construction contract sales, new market expansion, and key account management. He may work on forging relationships with decision-makers in target industries (hospital CEOs, university planners, etc.), responding to RFPs for major projects, and identifying emerging opportunities (such as new commercial developments in the region). Mitchell’s role requires understanding all of Lee Company’s services in order to cross-sell integrated solutions. He likely collaborates with marketing on branding and messaging and with the operations teams to align on what jobs to pursue. Under his leadership, Lee Company has pursued innovative projects (the company’s presence in smart building projects and design-build opportunities can be partially attributed to strategic business development efforts).

This leadership team collectively guides Lee Company’s vision: many of them have tenure that predates major growth spurts and thus ensure continuity of the company’s culture and values. Their combined expertise – from financial acumen to technical trade knowledge – positions Lee Company to be both stable and innovative. For instance, long-serving leaders guard the company’s customer-first, employee-friendly ethos, while newer leaders (like the Strategic Transformation director, next section) drive modern improvements. The BRM candidate can expect to interact with several of these executives: e.g., working with Tom Goddard (IT) and Christy Wyse (Transformation) on technology projects, or with Dan Kalman and the service VPs to understand operational needs. Understanding each leader’s focus will help the BRM in communicating effectively and aligning proposals with strategic priorities.

### Internal Terminology Cheat Sheet

Like many organizations, Lee Company has its share of internal terminology and acronyms. Here’s a glossary of common Lee Company-specific terms that a new Business Relationship Manager should know:
	•	FM² (FM Squared): Stands for Facilities Management & Maintenance ￼. This is the branded division of Lee Company that provides comprehensive facility management services to clients. When someone mentions “FM² contract” or “FM² team,” they are referring to outsourced facility operations that Lee Company manages for a client. (Think of FM² as an all-in-one facilities department for hire – covering HVAC, electrical, plumbing, cleaning coordination, etc., for large facilities). It’s a key growth area and has dedicated leadership (EVP Bob Lunny) and sales (SVP Steve Scott).
	•	Lee Company+ (Lee Company Plus): This refers to the Home Maintenance Plan membership for residential customers ￼. Internally, employees might say “the customer has Lee Company+” meaning they are a member entitled to their annual inspections and discounts. It’s essentially a subscription that provides preventive maintenance visits (4 per year – heating, cooling, plumbing, electrical) and perks like priority service and no after-hours fees for homeowners ￼. For the BRM, understanding Lee Company+ is important because any CRM or scheduling system changes must accommodate those recurring visits and member discounts.
	•	People Services: The internal name for the Human Resources (HR) department ￼. Lee Company uses “People Services” to emphasize its focus on employees as people, not just resources. So discussions about recruiting, training, benefits, etc., will fall under People Services (led by SVP Shelley Lambing). An employee might say “check with People Services about that policy” – meaning the HR team.
	•	Smart Buildings Group: The team and service offering focused on integrating technology into building systems ￼. This could involve IoT sensors, automation controls, energy management systems, and other “smart” tech in facilities. Internally, this team may also be referred to by the specific solutions they offer (for example, building automation systems – BAS). Knowing this term is crucial as Lee Company differentiates itself with these capabilities. The Smart Buildings Group often collaborates with FM² and Construction on projects that require high-tech solutions.
	•	Special Projects: While not a formal division name on the org chart, “Special Projects” usually refers to fast-turnaround or unique client projects that don’t fall into routine service or large construction. For example, an urgent plant shutdown repair or a highly custom installation might be handled by a “Special Projects” crew. In internal conversation, someone might say “Special Projects team handled that Chattanooga emergency job” – meaning a select group of technicians and project managers took on a non-standard job (like the case study where a 6-month repair was finished in 5 days) ￼. Special Projects often require intensive coordination and are a point of pride for showcasing Lee Company’s agility.
	•	Vans4Cans: The nickname for Lee Company’s annual food drive initiative ￼. Each year the company runs “Vans4Cans” where employees and customers donate canned goods that Lee Company collects (often using company vans as drop-off points, hence the name) to benefit the Second Harvest Food Bank. This is part of Lee Company’s community programs. As a BRM or any manager, being aware of Vans4Cans (and participating) is a good way to connect with the culture. It’s not a technical term, but it’s frequently mentioned in fall each year.
	•	Top Wrench / Top Workplace: “Top Wrench” isn’t a Lee term but a hypothetical example – however, Top Workplace is an external award that Lee Company has won multiple times from The Tennessean. Internally, you might hear “We made the Top Workplaces Hall of Fame,” which refers to being a Top Workplace four times (thus Hall of Fame status) ￼. This term underscores the pride employees have in their workplace culture. The BRM might leverage this in employer branding or HR tech projects (for instance, highlighting it on internal portals or recruitment pages).
	•	ACCA and ABC: These are industry bodies – ACCA (Air Conditioning Contractors of America) and ABC (Associated Builders and Contractors). Lee Company folks often reference them regarding awards or certifications. For example, “Contractor of the Year 2017 by ACCA” is a bragging point ￼, and “ABC Excellence in Construction Awards” come up when discussing project success ￼. While not Lee-specific acronyms, they are part of the internal language when celebrating achievements.
	•	BRM (Business Relationship Manager): Finally, the role you’re interviewing for – while Business Relationship Manager is a general title in the industry, at Lee Company the BRM is likely embedded in the Strategic Transformation/IT side. Internally, this might be a new term for some. Be prepared to explain how a BRM works, perhaps positioning it as “an internal consultant connecting our business units with the right technology solutions and process improvements.” Once you’re on board, you may define the BRM term for Lee Company by demonstrating its value.

This cheat sheet should help decipher internal conversations. For example, an email might say: “FM² landed a new account with a manufacturing client, and the Smart Buildings group will be installing sensors there. Need BRM/IT to coordinate on integration. Let’s loop in People Services to ensure training is provided to the FM² techs. Also, great job team on the ABC award for that project!” – Now you can parse that: the facilities management division got a new client, the tech integration team will do their part, the BRM/IT (you) must help integrate systems, HR will train folks, and they referenced an industry award as a kudos. Over time, you’ll pick up even more Lee Company lingo, but these core terms will get you off to a running start.

### Competitor Landscape in Tennessee

Lee Company operates in a competitive market, with both local and national players in the HVAC, mechanical contracting, and facilities services space. As a Business Relationship Manager, understanding the competitive landscape can help in recognizing where Lee Company stands out. Here are some major competitors in Tennessee and how they compare:
	•	Hiller Plumbing, Heating, Cooling & Electrical (Hiller LLC): Often branded as “Happy Hiller,” this is one of the most prominent residential service competitors in Tennessee. Hiller, founded in 1990, has grown rapidly in the home services arena. They employ around 600–800 technicians and staff and operate over 500 service trucks across 16 locations in the region ￼ ￼. Hiller’s estimated annual revenue is in the range of $130–$150 million in recent years ￼, about half of Lee Company’s revenue. Their focus is heavily on residential HVAC, plumbing, and electrical services (repair and replacement), and they are known for aggressive marketing (cheerful branding, “Happy You’ll Be or the Service is Free” guarantee). Unlike Lee Company, Hiller does not have a construction division for large projects, nor do they typically provide long-term facility management for commercial clients. This means Hiller is often competing with Lee Company for homeowner business and perhaps light commercial service, but not for hospital construction jobs or industrial maintenance contracts. Lee Company’s competitive advantage over Hiller lies in its broader service offerings and longer legacy – Lee Company can leverage its construction engineering expertise and facilities solutions, whereas Hiller generally sticks to home and small business markets. However, Hiller’s strength is its singular focus on customer service for homes, which has earned it strong brand recognition. Both companies were often listed among Inc. 5000 fastest-growing firms in past years ￼, indicating a healthy market. In Tennessee, Lee Company and Hiller are the two big names a homeowner will encounter; Lee Company tends to highlight its family heritage and one-stop-shop capabilities, whereas Hiller emphasizes its rapid response and cheerful service. For a BRM, noting these differences could inform how Lee Company’s internal systems support its unique selling points (e.g., the ability to coordinate a wider range of services seamlessly, which Hiller might not do if they lack a certain division).
	•	Comfort Systems USA (CSUSA): Comfort Systems USA is a national HVAC/mechanical contracting conglomerate (NYSE: FIX) that has a presence in Tennessee via its local subsidiaries. Rather than a single brand presence to the public like Lee or Hiller, CSUSA operates by acquiring strong regional contractors. In Tennessee, they have acquired companies such as Tennessee Electric Company, Inc. (TEC) and Dillingham & Smith Mechanical in Nashville, as well as ShoffnerKalthoff (SKMES) in Knoxville ￼ ￼. These acquisitions mean CSUSA competes in the commercial construction and industrial contracting segments. For example, Dillingham & Smith is a Nashville-based mechanical and sheet metal contractor that now falls under the CSUSA umbrella, bidding on projects similar to those Lee Company pursues. Comfort Systems’ strategy is to provide the capital and network of a large corporation (over $6 billion in revenue nationally) ￼ while letting local firms operate somewhat independently. Lee Company’s advantage here is being locally owned and more integrated: Lee can bundle services (construction + maintenance) under one contract, whereas CSUSA firms might focus only on construction and then hand off to another entity for service. Additionally, Lee Company’s family-owned culture can appeal to clients who prefer local partnership over a national chain. That said, CSUSA companies are formidable in bidding for large construction projects – they have significant resources and often specialize. For instance, a CSUSA subsidiary might excel in big industrial HVAC installations and could undercut or outbid on certain projects. Lee Company mitigates this by its reputation and relationships in Tennessee; having been a community fixture, it often has the home-field advantage. Also, Lee’s ability to do design-build (taking on design responsibilities) and its extensive in-house workforce can be a differentiator against competitors that rely more on subcontracting. From a BRM perspective, staying ahead might involve ensuring Lee Company’s project management and estimation systems are top-notch to compete with the efficiencies of large competitors, and highlighting to clients the continuity Lee offers (build it and maintain it for years after).
	•	Local & Regional Contractors: Apart from Hiller and CSUSA affiliates, several other regional competitors exist:
	•	John Bouchard & Sons Co.: A Nashville-based mechanical contractor with a long history (founded 1900), focusing on industrial mechanical, electrical, and repair services. They compete mainly in specialized mechanical work and fabrication. Lee Company’s broader scope and service division give it an edge in versatility, while Bouchard might be seen in heavy industrial niches.
	•	Roscoe Brown, Inc.: A Middle TN HVAC company (based in Murfreesboro, TN) that does both residential and commercial HVAC. Smaller than Lee Company, but a well-known name especially in Rutherford County. They might vie for some of the same residential customers or small commercial jobs, but do not have the multi-trade depth of Lee.
	•	One Hour Heating & Air / ARS Rescue Rooter: These are national franchise networks present in Tennessee (ARS has a big Nashville operation). They focus on residential HVAC/plumbing service and replacements. They are competitors to Lee’s residential segment, often using heavy advertising. Lee Company’s advantage is offering local trust and additional services (like electrical, home improvements) that some of these franchises don’t.
	•	JCI, Trane, and OEM Service arms: For facility services, big equipment manufacturers like Trane (Ingersoll Rand) and Johnson Controls have service departments that maintain HVAC systems for clients. They compete in the commercial maintenance space (e.g., servicing chillers in large buildings). Lee Company, however, can position itself as more vendor-neutral and comprehensive (servicing all systems, not just HVAC, and handling construction needs too). Also, Lee’s FM² can take on a more outsourced role than an OEM service group typically would.
	•	Hiller’s Commercial Division & Others: Hiller, primarily residential, does have some commercial service contracts. Similarly, Facility Management companies (like CBRE or JLL) might not perform maintenance themselves but sometimes subcontract firms like Lee; in some cases, they can be seen as competition if a client is debating between hiring Lee Company vs. hiring a CBRE-managed solution (who might then just hire subcontractors). In those cases, Lee Company often touts the benefit of dealing directly with the service provider (them) rather than a middle-man.

In summary, Lee Company’s competitive edge in Tennessee comes from its comprehensiveness and legacy. Competitors like Hiller match up on residential service but lack commercial construction capabilities; national players like CSUSA match up on big construction but lack the home service and personal local touch. Few, if any, competitors provide the full suite that Lee Company does: designing and constructing a facility, installing all mechanical systems, then offering ongoing maintenance, and also being able to fix Mrs. Smith’s home AC the same day. This one-stop capability, along with a reputation for quality (e.g., Lee Company’s long list of awards for excellence and ethics), is a key selling point. As a BRM, knowing these differentiators helps in shaping internal initiatives: e.g., ensuring that Lee’s customer experience (enabled by IT) highlights that seamless, integrated service – something competitors with narrower focuses might not provide. It also means Lee Company must continue to excel in each domain (since competitors specialize, Lee must not be outdone in any one area). The Tennessee market remains strong, and Lee Company is well-positioned as a leader among its peers.

### Christy Wyse – Leadership Profile & Role in BRM Partnership

Christy Wyse serves as Lee Company’s Director of Strategic Transformation (since October 2020) ￼. Her role is essentially to drive enterprise-level change initiatives that align with the company’s strategy – making her a likely key stakeholder or sponsor for the Business Relationship Manager. Let’s break down her background, leadership focus, and how she will interface with a BRM:

Background and Past Roles: Christy brings a wealth of experience in change management, human capital management (HCM), and financial processes. Prior to joining Lee Company, she worked as an Affiliate Consultant with North Highland (a well-respected management consulting firm) from 2017 to 2020, specializing in HCM, accounting, and payroll tax projects for various clients ￼. Earlier, she held roles including Strategic Business Consultant at Mosaic Consultants, and a Senior Subject Matter Expert in Payroll & Tax at Delek US Holdings (a Fortune 500 downstream energy company) ￼. Her corporate career was largely forged at Corizon Health, where she rose to Vice President of Payroll & Human Capital Management ￼. At Corizon (a large healthcare services provider), Christy achieved notable transformations – for instance, she “stabilized [a] post-conversion PeopleSoft environment and implemented a cloud-based HCM system” during her tenure as VP ￼. This accomplishment is significant: it means she took a faltering HR/payroll software implementation and turned it around, introducing a new cloud HR system to improve operations. She also started at Corizon as an Assistant Corporate Controller, giving her a strong accounting and business background ￼. Christy’s academic credentials include a Bachelor’s degree in Accounting and Business/Management from Belmont University ￼ – a solid foundation for the analytical and financial aspects of transformation work.

Leadership Focus and Strategic Priorities: Christy Wyse is foremost a change leader and strategist. Her LinkedIn profile highlights Top Skills such as Change Management, Business Planning, and Strategic Planning, and she’s a Prosci® Certified Change Practitioner ￼ – indicating formal training in managing organizational change. At Lee Company, her focus is on strategic transformation initiatives: these could range from implementing new enterprise systems (ERP, CRM, field service software) to reengineering business processes for efficiency, and championing cultural or organizational changes to support growth. Since coming on board in late 2020, Christy has likely set and executed priorities such as: improving internal communications, breaking down silos between departments, and introducing data-driven decision-making tools. A concrete example of her impact is Lee Company’s recognition by Prophix (the financial software vendor) – being named the “Most Innovative Prophix Customer of the Year” in 2024 ￼ suggests that under Christy’s guidance, Lee Company adopted and creatively used Prophix for financial planning or analytics. That kind of initiative – selecting a new software, rolling it out company-wide, and driving adoption – is exactly in her wheelhouse. Christy’s strategy likely involves modernizing Lee Company’s internal infrastructure to enable its growth (whether that’s migrating to cloud-based platforms, automating workflows, or instituting KPIs and dashboards for performance tracking). She also likely prioritizes cross-departmental collaboration – given her background bridging HR, IT, and finance, she’s adept at making different parts of an organization work together on big changes. Her consulting experience at North Highland indicates she brings an outsider’s perspective to problem-solving, which can be invaluable in questioning the status quo and introducing best practices from other industries.

Notable Transformations Led: Aside from the Corizon HCM system implementation noted above ￼, Christy has a track record of transformation:
	•	At Delek US, in a short 1+ year stint, she “led reconciliation, correction and balancing of payroll and payroll tax for post-conversion implementation” and “implemented controls and processes to stabilize [the] environment” ￼. This implies she stepped into a chaotic situation (post-conversion, likely meaning after a new system or merger had messed up payroll) and systematically fixed it. Such an achievement shows her skill in getting into the details, identifying root causes, and executing fixes that have company-wide financial impact.
	•	At Lee Company, while specific projects under her tenure are not publicly detailed, we can infer some: possibly the overhaul of the customer and employee portals, integration of mobile tools for field staff, enhancing of data analytics capabilities, and spearheading any Lean/Six Sigma style operational improvements. Since she started in late 2020, one big initiative could have been navigating the pandemic-era challenges – maybe digitizing processes (like moving to virtual training or remote work solutions for some staff) and ensuring business continuity. Additionally, Lee Company’s growth into new markets (KY, AL) may have required internal transformation (scaling processes, standardizing operations across offices), something she would oversee.

Role in BRM Candidate’s Future Responsibilities: As a Business Relationship Manager, you will very likely work hand-in-hand with Christy Wyse. In many organizations, the BRM function sits within the IT or Transformation team, translating business needs to the technical team and vice versa – which sounds exactly like the connective tissue Christy would want to cultivate. Here’s how the partnership may unfold:
	•	Christy as a Mentor/Sponsor: Christy will set the agenda for strategic projects and the BRM will help execute them by ensuring business stakeholder engagement. Expect that Christy will outline broad transformation goals (e.g., “implement a new scheduling system for Home Services by next Q3” or “improve field-to-office communication flow”) and the BRM will work under her direction to gather detailed requirements, build consensus, and liaise with IT and vendors. Christy’s extensive experience in both IT implementations and business processes means she’ll provide guidance on best practices and potential pitfalls.
	•	Collaborative Planning: You might join Christy in meetings with department heads (Service, Construction, etc.) to identify pain points and opportunities. Christy’s presence signals to those departments that these initiatives have top-level backing. She’ll rely on you to maintain those relationships day-to-day – essentially you become her envoy to the various business units. Her role can be thought of as the strategist/exec sponsor, while the BRM is the tactical facilitator.
	•	Change Management Emphasis: Given Christy’s change management expertise, you will likely be involved in the people side of projects as much as the technical side. For instance, when rolling out a new system, Christy will plan training, communications, and adoption metrics (using her Prosci ADKAR toolkit, perhaps). As BRM, you’ll help by communicating changes early to end-users, securing “change champions” in each department, and feeding back user sentiments. Essentially, you will help Christy ensure that transformations are not just installed, but also embraced by employees – a critical success factor she will insist on.
	•	Strategic Alignment: Christy will also involve the BRM in aligning IT initiatives to business strategy. She might have you help develop business cases for new technology investments, where you’d gather data on how a change could increase revenue or efficiency. Your role is to articulate business value, something Christy as a strategic leader will present to the CEO/CFO for budget approval. Through this process, you’ll learn directly from her how to balance technical possibilities with business priorities.
	•	Notable Interactions: It’s possible the BRM will report directly to Christy Wyse, or at least have a dotted-line report. In many organizations, BRMs report to a Director of Transformation or CIO equivalent. If that’s the case, Christy will be your boss, setting your objectives and evaluating your performance. Even if the BRM role is housed under IT (Tom Goddard), Christy will be closely involved in steering your work. Therefore, building a strong working relationship with her – understanding her vision and communication style – will be key. The fact that Christy reports into the executive team (likely to CEO or an EVP) means she can champion the BRM’s work at high levels, giving you the air cover to drive change.
	•	Christy’s Leadership Style: While we don’t have explicit info on her management style, clues from her background (mix of consulting and corporate roles) suggest she values data-driven decisions, clear planning, and stakeholder engagement. She probably expects proactivity and professionalism – traits honed as a consultant. But coming from an accounting/finance origin too, she’ll appreciate attention to detail and compliance. As BRM, when working with her, you’d want to be prepared with facts and analyses (speak to her analytic side), but also be ready to brainstorm creative solutions (speaking to her change agent side). She has navigated complex corporate politics in prior roles, so she’ll likely coach you on influencing others without direct authority – a core skill for a BRM.

Christy Wyse’s Vision likely aligns with making Lee Company “future-ready”: adopting new technologies, refining processes, and building a culture receptive to change. In that pursuit, the Business Relationship Manager is almost an extension of Christy’s own role – a liaison embedded in the business who can surface needs and shepherd projects to completion in line with that vision. One could say, Christy defines “what” strategic changes need to happen, and the BRM helps figure out “how” they can practically happen by working with all the players involved.

In conclusion, Christy Wyse is a transformational leader whose experience in accounting and HR systems, coupled with formal change management expertise, uniquely equips her to spearhead Lee Company’s evolution. For the BRM candidate, she will be an invaluable leader to work with – expect to learn a great deal from her on managing complex projects and driving adoption. Your future responsibilities will likely be shaped by Christy’s strategic roadmap: you’ll translate her strategic initiatives into executable projects, ensure business alignment at every step, and communicate progress back to her. She has led notable transformations in her career (like major system implementations and process overhauls) ￼ ￼, and as a BRM you will be at the forefront of Lee Company’s next wave of transformations hand-in-hand with Christy Wyse.
