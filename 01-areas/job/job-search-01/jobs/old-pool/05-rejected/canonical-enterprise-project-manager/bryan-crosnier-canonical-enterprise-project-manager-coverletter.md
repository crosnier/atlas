Application for **Enterprise Project Manager**

Dear Canonical Hiring Team,
To be blunt, I haven't held the title but I've already been doing the job.

While I haven’t formally held the titles of Project Manager, Product Owner, or Scrum Master, I’ve regularly performed the key responsibilities of all three—often simultaneously. Many of my projects, especially over the past 5 years, operated like internal startups within the larger Aerospace/Defense org, where I led delivery from concept through operational execution across multiple teams. Along the way, I’ve also stepped in as developer, operator, and vendor wrangler - whatever it took to get it shipped.

I’d like the opportunity to walk you through a few of my recent projects, so you can decide if I’m the right fit for your team.

Over the past 18 years, I’ve supported operations, sales, customer success, accounting, mission operators, developers, and DevOps teams through mission critical enterprise system implementations - connecting business needs with technical execution in growth-focused environments. I'm uniquely aware of the needs of many user personas's requirements and can bring 

At Maxar Technologies, I served as a subject matter expert on high-impact projects involving a myriad of tools and a range of mission-critical software. I led strategic operations planning, scoped system and integration requirements, and facilitated cross-functional collaboration between business units and development teams. These initiatives spanned from concept definition through deployment and post-launch support.

On a personal note, I'm an avid homelabber, pc gamer, and tech geek who acknowledges Canonical's contributions to the open source world as playing a large part in enabling my obsessions. At the risk of sounding too unprofessional - it'd be awesome to work with you and be a part of Canonical.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,
Bryan Crosnier
