### Cover Letter Front Loading
*attempting to draft content to land the job in the first paragraph.*

To be blunt, I haven't held the title but I've already been doing the job.

While I haven‚Äôt formally held the titles of Project Manager, Product Owner, or Scrum Master, I‚Äôve regularly performed the key responsibilities of all three‚Äîoften simultaneously. Many of my projects - especially over the past 5 years - operated like internal startups within the larger Aerospace/Defense org, where I led delivery from concept through operational execution across multiple teams. Along the way, I‚Äôve also stepped in as developer, operator, and vendor wrangler - whatever it took to get it shipped.

I‚Äôd like the opportunity to walk you through a few of my recent projects, so you can decide if I‚Äôm the right fit for your team.

On a personal note, I'm an avid homelabber, pc gamer and tech geek who acknowledges Canonical's contributions to the open source world as playing a large part in enabling my obsessions. At the risk of sounding too unprofessional - it'd be awesome to work with you and be a part of Canonical.


### Application Questions

‚∏ª

Describe the top highlight of your project management career?

Honestly, I have two of extremely different projects i'm equally proud of and consider to be top highilghts.

Self-Service Ordering Service and UI -- crafted the full business requirements package, partnered in the business case creation, ran in-person demos to secure initial funding from the U.S. Government, and went on to spend the next 4 years engaged in building out different phases and iterations of the solution. It ended up becoming the foundation of mulltiple tools still serving tens of millions in product revenue to Commerical,  U.S., and International Defense customers.

Mission-critical Voice Net solution -- Designed and implemented a cost-effective, software-based voice communication solution for the Mission Operations Center, enabling seamless collaboration among distributed personnel and enhancing operational workflows. This solution reduced projected hardware costs from $1.1 million to $8,000, providing a scalable and secure environment that met all program requirements. This system continues to be a foundational tool faciliting satellite launch, commissioning, and sustainment operations for Maxar Technologies.

‚∏ª

Tell us what is exciting to you about managing projects in the IT industry today?

Projects continue to move fast, customer requirements change mid-flight, things get broken, and overall requires you stay sharp. While IT projects are still usually laser focused on specific obectives, corporate environments are finally opening up to leveraging technology innovations in new and creative ways. In some ways, the landscape is becoming a bit like a playground - finding room for innovative ways of accomplishing traditional objectives.   When you get to be the person who connects a business need to a working, reliable system - that‚Äôs a great day.

‚∏ª

Discuss your customer-facing project management experience.

I‚Äôve spent most of my career in roles where I‚Äôm the translator between tech and humans. Whether it was operators, execs, or engineers, I‚Äôve had to gather input, explain tradeoffs, manage expectations, and still deliver something that works. At Maxar, I was often in front of customers (commercial and defense) and internal stakeholders‚Äîscoping features, demoing progress, and handling escalations while keeping the project on track. I enjoy the dynamic and know how to keep people aligned when everyone has a different stake in the outcome.

‚∏ª

How many years of customer-facing experience do you have?

18+ years

‚∏ª

How did you perform in mathematics at high school?

Top 10%

‚∏ª

How did you perform in your native language at high school?

Top 10%

‚∏ª

Please share your rationale or evidence for the high school performance selections above.

I was always near the top of my class in math and English. Scored well on the SATs (back when that was still a thing), and placed into advanced courses in both. It wasn‚Äôt just about grades‚ÄîI liked solving problems and writing clearly, which is basically still what I do every day, just with more complexity and way more Slack messages.

‚∏ª

What was your bachelor‚Äôs university degree result?

3.5 / 4.0 GPA (standard US system)

‚∏ª

Are you willing and able to commit to 2‚Äì4 international in-person events per year?

Yes, absolutely.

‚∏ª

Want me to drop the rest of the boilerplate entries too (like veteran status, gender, etc.) or just stick to the content sections where tone matters most?
