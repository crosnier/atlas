### ATS Assessment

Here’s the ATS simulator compatibility analysis for the Senior IT Internal Auditor role at Deloitte, using your résumé and scoring it across the three models: Taleo, Workday, and iCIMS.

⸻

🧪 Compatibility Scores (Out of 100)

ATS Model	Score	Pass Threshold	Verdict
Taleo	58	60	❌ Needs work
Workday	74	70	✅ Moderate Fit
iCIMS	65	60	✅ Acceptable


⸻

🧠 Model-by-Model Breakdown

🔵 Taleo (Binary Match Logic)

Scoring Basis:
	•	Checks if keywords/phrases are present (yes/no)
	•	No weighting or semantics

Key Matches:
	•	“Process improvement”
	•	“Systems integration”
	•	“Technical implementation”
	•	“Change leadership”
	•	“Operations strategist”
	•	“Cross-functional collaboration”

Key Misses:
	•	“Internal audit”
	•	“Risk assessment”
	•	“Fraud”
	•	“Information security”
	•	“SOX” / “CISA” / “CIA” / “controls”

🧩 Taleo Verdict: You’re missing critical audit-specific phrasing. You match general strategy/ops language but not the audit/control vocabulary they’re filtering for.

⸻

🟢 Workday (Weighted Logic + Frequency)

Scoring Basis:
	•	Keywords in high-priority sections = bonus
	•	Repeated phrases = bonus
	•	Penalizes absences of required terms

Strengths:
	•	High match on system implementation, efficiency, and strategic terms
	•	Great frequency on “process,” “strategy,” “operations,” and “technology”
	•	Strong action verbs and quantifiable achievements

Weaknesses:
	•	Low frequency of direct “audit,” “control,” “risk,” and “compliance” language
	•	Lacks direct mention of frameworks like COBIT, SOX, NIST, etc.

🧠 Workday Verdict: Moderate match. You score well on transferable skills, but need to tune the résumé to mention audit and control-oriented work explicitly.

⸻

🔷 iCIMS (Skill Cluster Matching)

Scoring Basis:
	•	Groups keywords into skill “clusters”
	•	Scores matches across broad categories like:
	•	IT Systems / Infrastructure
	•	Risk / Audit / Security
	•	Process Improvement / Change Management

Matches:
	•	✅ Process Optimization
	•	✅ Systems Integration
	•	✅ Strategic Planning
	•	⚠️ Weak coverage of IT Audit / Risk cluster
	•	⚠️ Missing: CIA, CISA, internal audit framework terms

🧠 iCIMS Verdict: You align well in the strategic operations cluster, but need to strengthen coverage in the audit/risk cluster.

⸻

🛠 Recommendations to Improve All Scores

Add or expand on these topics in your résumé:
	•	🧾 “Internal controls,” “audit procedures,” “compliance frameworks,” “risk assessment”
	•	🔒 “Information security,” “IT governance,” “CISA,” “SOX compliance”
	•	📊 “Control testing,” “fraud risk,” “corrective action plans,” “internal audit standards”

Example Phrases to Incorporate:

- Led internal systems review to identify control gaps and recommend improvements aligned with SOX and NIST standards.
- Partnered with IT and compliance to define audit protocols and document internal controls.
- Participated in risk assessment sessions to evaluate system vulnerabilities and suggest control enhancements.
