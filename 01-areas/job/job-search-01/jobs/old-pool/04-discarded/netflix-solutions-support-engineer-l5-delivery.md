## üìì Notes



I don't have enough dev-related experience to effectively support Engineering teams:

Looking at the job description and your CV, the main areas where you might currently lack compatibility include:

1. **Advanced Observability Platforms:**
    
    While you have experience with certain tools, the job description emphasizes deep familiarity with observability platforms for metrics, logs, and tracing. Learning how to effectively use platforms like Grafana, Prometheus, or Datadog‚Äîand understanding their role in microservices architecture‚Äîwould strengthen your fit.
    
2. **In-depth CI/CD Knowledge Across Multiple Tools:**
    
    Although you have a background in CI/CD, this role specifically mentions extensive experience with a wide range of tools (Jenkins, GitLab CI, CircleCI, Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions). Becoming proficient in multiple CI/CD systems and understanding how to implement and optimize complex pipelines would be beneficial.
    
3. **Distributed Systems Expertise:**
    
    The job highlights a proven ability to diagnose and resolve issues within distributed systems. Gaining more hands-on experience with distributed architectures, troubleshooting network latency issues, and handling service failures would increase your alignment.
    
4. **Scripting and Automation Proficiency:**
    
    While you may have some scripting experience, the position calls for strong automation skills, including developing tools and scripts to streamline processes. Deepening your knowledge of scripting languages (e.g., Python, Bash) and learning how to create automated workflows could be key.
    
5. **GraphQL Schema Management and Compliance Knowledge:**
    
    Though not strictly required, having experience with GraphQL schema management, as well as understanding regulatory and compliance processes (eDiscovery, Data Retention, Auditing) mentioned in the job description, would make you a stronger candidate.
    

  

**Top Things to Learn:**

- Advanced usage of observability platforms (metrics, logging, tracing).
    
- Mastery of multiple CI/CD tools and best practices for pipeline optimization.
    
- Troubleshooting and managing distributed systems at scale.

- Writing and automating robust scripts and processes.
    
- GraphQL schema management and compliance-related topics (e.g., data governance).
