_IT/Operations Change Management – part of the Program Delivery function_

### **✳️ COMPATIBILITY DETAIL**

  

You align strongly with the Change Owner Manager role based on your deep experience in:

- Cross-functional collaboration
    
- Operational transformation
    
- Systems implementation
    
- Risk/impact evaluation
    
- Stakeholder communication
    
- Project/program leadership
    

  

Although the role sits in the Operations org, it demands a hybrid profile: someone who understands business operations, speaks the language of IT, and manages programs through change—exactly the skill blend you’ve honed across your Customer Operations Architect, Service Manager, and Strategist roles.

  

**Most aligned experience:**

- Managing the impact of operational change on people, process, and platforms
    
- Leading iterative, milestone-driven implementations
    
- Facilitating stakeholder alignment and surfacing risk
    
- Documenting systems/process changes
    
- Acting as primary point-of-contact across business and technical functions
    

  

**Minor Gaps:**

- You don’t hold a PMP or formal Change Management certification (not required, but referenced)
    
- No specific mention of international operations, which is called out in the description
    
- Preference for some IT background; while you’ve worked with IT and dev teams, this could be emphasized more
