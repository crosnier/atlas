## About the job

As a team, we‚Äôve launched five satellites into orbit, signed ten commercial deals worth over $1 billion in revenue, raised over $750 million from top global investors, and recruited a team of over 400 world-class engineers. We all work out of our (legendary) San Francisco office, which was once used to build ships during the World Wars.  
  
Our satellites, which operate from geostationary orbit (GEO), weigh only 400 kg and utilize a proprietary software-defined radio payload. Each satellite can connect over two million people, and we‚Äôre very excited for the impact we‚Äôll soon have in the Philippines, Peru, Mexico, and more!
