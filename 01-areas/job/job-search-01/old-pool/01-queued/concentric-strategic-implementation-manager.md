You are responsible for ensuring the solutions launched are both innovative and scalable for Trust Operations. You must constantly advocate for your customers and will have a key voice in influencing the development of solutions.

- Develop hypotheses and data collection plans when issues arise. Seek to prove or disprove through deep dive analysis.  
- Ensure lasting change through the ownership of key metrics and delivery of post-launch continuous improvement efforts. Once quality and performance have achieved target, develop comprehensive control plans for your customers to ensure their success.
