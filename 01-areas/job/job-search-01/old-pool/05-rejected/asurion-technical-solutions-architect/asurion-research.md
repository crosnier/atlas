Asurion: Company Overview and Key Insights

Company Background and Origin

Asurion is a privately-held “tech care” company headquartered in Nashville, TN, specializing in device insurance, extended warranties, repairs, and tech support services. The company traces its roots to a 1994 search fund startup by Stanford MBA graduates Kevin Taweel and Jim Ellis. In 1995 they acquired a Houston roadside-assistance firm (Road Rescue) and soon pivoted to mobile device protection by purchasing Nashville-based Merrimac Group in 1999 ￼ ￼. The combined entity rebranded as Asurion in 2001 – a name blending Sanskrit and Greek terms to evoke “safety” and “rescue” ￼. Asurion relocated its home base to Nashville in 2003 ￼ and steadily expanded globally over the 2000s, entering Asia (Seoul office in 2003) and Europe (London in 2008) ￼ ￼. Key growth milestones include merging with NEW (National Electronics Warranty) in 2008 to become a leader in retail extended warranties ￼, launching the first iPhone insurance product in 2010 ￼, and acquiring tech-support firm Soluto in 2013 ￼. In 2019, Asurion introduced its first direct-to-consumer subscription (Home+) and acquired uBreakiFix, the nation’s largest device repair chain ￼ ￼. Today, Asurion calls itself the “world’s largest tech care company,” with over 23,000 employees worldwide and 700+ service locations in the U.S. ￼ ￼. The company remains co-founded and led by Kevin Taweel (Executive Chairman) ￼ and has been owned by a consortium of private equity firms since a leveraged buyout in 2007 (e.g. Madison Dearborn, Providence Equity, etc.) ￼ ￼.

Products and Services (U.S. Domestic Focus)

Asurion’s product/service portfolio spans end-to-end technology support and protection, addressing the entire device lifecycle – from setup and usage to loss, repair, trade-in, and replacement. Major offerings in the U.S. include:
	•	Mobile Device Insurance & Protection Plans: Asurion is best known for providing wireless phone insurance and extended warranty programs. It partners with most major carriers (e.g. Verizon, AT&T) to cover smartphones against loss, theft, damage, and malfunction ￼. These plans often include perks like next-day device replacement and low-cost screen or battery repairs ￼ ￼. Asurion’s carrier-based programs serve tens of millions of subscribers, making it a leader in mobile protection. The company also offers standalone phone protection for consumers (e.g. Asurion Mobile Protection plans for unlocked phones) ￼ ￼.
	•	Home and Consumer Electronics Protection: Through products like Asurion Home+ and Asurion Appliance+, the company covers a broad array of electronics and appliances. Home+ is a ~$25–30/month plan that protects all of a household’s personal tech (TVs, laptops, smart devices, etc.) under one umbrella plan ￼ ￼. Appliance+ is a ~$34.99/month subscription focused on major appliances (washers, refrigerators, etc.) ￼. These plans allow unlimited claims (with certain caps) and provide repair or replacement for covered items. Asurion’s services extend even to niches like satellite TV equipment and jewelry insurance in some cases ￼ (legacy of acquisitions), although its core focus is on consumer electronics.
	•	Technical Support Services: Asurion operates 24/7 tech support hotlines and apps to help customers troubleshoot device issues or set up new tech. This includes “expert help anytime, anywhere” via call or chat for anything from onboarding a new phone to solving Wi-Fi problems ￼ ￼. For example, Asurion provides tech support add-on services for clients like home internet providers (e.g. Brightspeed Total Home Tech Support launched in 2025) ￼. The company’s experts (including those inherited from its Soluto acquisition) handle everything from software assistance to smart home device setup. These support services are often bundled with protection plans or offered as standalone subscriptions by carriers/ISPs. The breadth of support is a differentiator – Asurion’s Q1 2025 release notes it helps customers with “all the connected devices that power people’s lives,” from phones and computers to smart doorbells and thermostats ￼.
	•	Device Repair and Replacement Services: With the uBreakiFix by Asurion network of 700+ stores and “We Come to You” mobile repair vans, Asurion offers in-person repair for cracked screens, battery issues, and more ￼. Customers (even without a protection plan) can walk into a uBreakiFix store for same-day fixes on phones, tablets, and gaming consoles. Asurion’s scale in repair was underscored in 2023 when it became an authorized repair provider for Microsoft’s Xbox and Surface devices – a first for a third-party chain ￼. For irreparable devices under its insurance, Asurion leverages a vast logistics operation to ship out next-day replacements (often refurbished) from its warehouses ￼. The company boasts that in 85% of the U.S., an expert can be dispatched for same-day service ￼, highlighting the reach of its repair and replacement infrastructure.
	•	Device Trade-In and Upgrade Programs: Asurion also manages trade-in programs for carriers and retailers. Notably, in April 2025 it launched a new trade-in program with Cricket Wireless that lets customers exchange old phones for bill credits at any time ￼ ￼. Asurion handles the entire backend: online trade-in portal, shipping logistics, device grading, and either refurbishing or recycling the used phones. Its “Technology Logistics Center” in Smyrna, TN processes trade-in devices by wiping data and evaluating the device’s “next best use” (resale, recycle, etc.) ￼. This service leverages Asurion’s supply chain and refurbishing expertise, which Cricket’s CMO noted has been “trusted…for over a decade” ￼. In short, Asurion has evolved into a one-stop shop for device lifecycle management – from protecting new devices to repairing broken ones and facilitating upgrades via trade-ins ￼.
	•	Installation and On-Site Services: Increasingly, Asurion offers installation/setup services for smart home gadgets and AV equipment. For example, its partnership with Blue Stream Fiber (a regional ISP) in 2025 includes an option where customers get TVs, doorbells, and thermostats installed by Asurion experts (up to 2 installs per year) ￼ ￼. This shows Asurion’s push into “last-mile” in-home services, complementing its protection plans. The company’s technicians essentially serve as the “Geek Squad” equivalent for many partner brands, handling in-home tech needs that go beyond phone repairs.

Domestic Product Summary: In the U.S., Asurion’s offerings range from mobile protection plans (via carriers and retailers) to multi-device protection subscriptions (Home+/Appliance+), 24/7 tech support services, nationwide device repair (uBreakiFix), and device trade-in programs. This integrated suite is often delivered white-labeled through partners (e.g. Verizon Total Mobile Protection, or Home Depot’s appliance protection powered by Asurion) as well as under Asurion’s own name for direct consumers. The company emphasizes its “end-to-end” model – e.g. a customer who breaks a phone can file a claim online, get a replacement shipped next-day or a same-day screen repair at a local shop, and also trade in the old device for credit – all through Asurion’s coordinated system ￼ ￼.

(Fact-based sources above substantiate Asurion’s product breadth. Any items not explicitly cited – such as general knowledge that Asurion powers carrier programs – are drawn from the context of Asurion’s press releases and industry reputation.)

Customers and Partners

Asurion primarily operates a B2B2C model, serving end-consumers in partnership with big industry clients. Its customers therefore include both millions of everyday device users and the major companies who offer Asurion’s services as part of their own customer offerings. Key partner categories:
	•	Wireless Carriers: Asurion’s largest clients are the big U.S. mobile carriers. Verizon, AT&T, and many regional/mobile virtual network operators use Asurion to run their device insurance programs and tech support add-ons. In early 2025, Asurion announced long-term contract extensions with two of the country’s largest wireless carriers (names not stated, but presumably Verizon and AT&T) ￼, locking in these relationships well into the next decade. It also added smaller carriers – for example, Breezeline Mobile, a cable operator launching wireless service, partnered with Asurion in 2024–25 to provide device protection to its subscribers ￼. Asurion’s value to carriers is its ability to drive customer loyalty: by handling claims, repairs, and upgrades smoothly, it helps carriers keep subscribers satisfied ￼. The reach is enormous – through its clients, Asurion supports nearly 300 million consumer devices worldwide ￼, with a large portion of those in the U.S.
	•	Electronics Retailers & OEMs: Asurion also partners with retailers like Amazon, Walmart, Costco, Staples and manufacturers like Samsung and Google to provide protection plans. For instance, Amazon teamed up with Asurion to offer the new “Asurion Complete Protect” subscription, covering past and future Amazon purchases under one plan ￼. Google selected Asurion in 2025 as the new provider of its “Preferred Care” extended warranty program for Pixel devices ￼ (replacing a competitor). Similarly, Asurion powers protection plans for Staples office electronics ￼ and has long handled extended warranties for Amazon product purchases (previously via individual item plans, and now via the $16.99/month Complete Protect ￼). The company’s authorized repair partnerships with OEMs – e.g. being an authorized service provider for Microsoft (Xbox and Surface) ￼ and Samsung (through uBreakiFix) – further embed it in the OEM value chain. These partnerships show that Asurion isn’t just an insurer; it’s also a repair and logistics arm for manufacturers and retailers, delivering warranty and support services on their behalf.
	•	Cable and Broadband Providers: A growing client segment is ISPs and cable companies that want to offer tech support or device protection to their internet customers. As noted, Blue Stream Fiber (a regional fiber ISP) now offers Asurion-powered “Advanced Tech Care” and device protection as add-ons ￼ ￼. Brightspeed (a telecom provider in the Midwest/South) similarly partnered with Asurion in 2025 to bundle tech support with its fiber internet ￼. These deals piggyback on Asurion’s Home+ style capabilities – essentially letting smaller operators provide whole-home tech protection and helpdesk services without building that expertise in-house. Through its August 2024 partnership with Reach (a mobile platform provider), Asurion made its device protection and trade-in solutions available to 40+ million households served by regional cable operators in the NCTC cooperative ￼ ￼. This effectively opened a new distribution channel, where dozens of local carriers can easily plug into Asurion’s program via Reach’s platform.
	•	Direct Consumers: Although most of Asurion’s business is through partners, it does market direct-to-consumer offerings. Asurion Home+ (covering nearly all home tech) and Appliance+ are sold directly online. Consumers can also go straight to uBreakiFix stores for repairs, or to Asurion’s website for device protection on unlocked phones. However, these direct channels are a smaller slice of Asurion’s reach compared to its massive partner network. The company’s strategy has been to embed itself in the offerings of well-known brands – so the end-user might recognize the carrier or retailer’s branding more than Asurion’s. That said, Asurion’s own name is fairly visible now (e.g. “uBreakiFix by Asurion” signage, and the Asurion branding on apps and claim websites).

Customer Experience: Whether through a carrier or directly, an end-customer interacting with Asurion can file a claim 24/7 (web or phone) ￼, get same-day or next-day resolution for many issues (repair or replace) ￼ ￼, and even receive in-person tech help in many locations ￼. Asurion emphasizes reducing the “frustration” of tech problems ￼ – a message it uses to market its value to partners. Notably, Asurion’s partners often highlight customer satisfaction: e.g. Blue Stream’s SVP said the Asurion partnership “enhances everyday life for customers” by providing built-in device support ￼. This focus on customer loyalty outcomes is likely a key reason carriers stick with Asurion and renew contracts long-term ￼.

(All factual claims about partnerships and customer types are supported by press releases: e.g. carrier contracts ￼, Reach platform deal ￼, Amazon Complete Protect ￼, Google and Microsoft collaborations ￼, etc. The generalization of Asurion’s B2B2C model is drawn from these specific examples.)

Financial Performance (Revenue, Growth, and Debt)

Revenue: Asurion is the largest private company in Nashville by revenue, posting approximately $9.3 billion in revenue for 2024 ￼. This was a slight increase from about $9.1 billion in 2023 ￼ (2023 grew ~9% over a weaker 2022, reflecting recovery after losing a major client in 2020 ￼). While private companies aren’t required to disclose detailed financials, an S&P credit report confirms the $9.3B figure for 2024 and notes that the majority of revenue comes from Asurion’s Americas segment ￼. Net income/profit figures are not publicly released; however, Asurion’s business is known to be cash-generative (balancing that, it carries substantial debt – discussed shortly).

2025 Outlook: Industry analysts project modest top-line growth in 2025 for Asurion. S&P Global Ratings stated it expects “positive overall topline growth in 2025, with revenue growth in the Americas offsetting continued international [pressure]” ￼. In practice, this could mean low single-digit percentage growth. If 2025 grows say ~3–5%, Asurion could approach or exceed $9.5–10 billion in revenue (hypothetically pushing it toward the $10B mark). Indeed, Asurion has been re-accelerating via new partnerships – e.g. adding Google’s warranty business, expanding into new operator channels – which should bolster U.S. revenue. However, certain international segments might be declining (perhaps legacy operations in Asia/Europe), tempering overall growth ￼.

Profitability and Debt: Asurion is highly leveraged due to its private equity ownership. The company took on significant debt in buyouts and shareholder payouts – notably a $3.75 billion dividend recap loan in 2018 that brought total term loans outstanding to $11.3 billion ￼ ￼. As of late 2024, Asurion has been paying down some debt and refinancing at better terms. S&P upgraded the recovery rating on Asurion’s senior debt in 2025, citing debt reduction and a greater weighting of earnings in the U.S. market (which presumably is more profitable) ￼. Credit agencies still rate Asurion as non-investment grade – Moody’s rates it B1 with a stable outlook (affirmed May 2025), and S&P rates its unsecured debt B+ and first-lien debt BB- ￼. These ratings reflect a high debt-to-EBITDA leverage (historically around 5–7× EBITDA) and the financial risk of its capital structure. For context, after the 2018 loans, leverage spiked to ~6.5× EBITDA ￼, and while it may have improved slightly since, it likely remains in mid-single-digit territory.

On the bright side, Asurion’s operating cash flow is strong – its core insurance and service businesses generate recurring revenue and cash that help service the debt. The company has been able to refinance maturities (e.g. issuing a new $1.25B term loan in 2023 to push out debt and for general purposes ￼) and avoid liquidity crunches. In fact, S&P in 2025 expected Asurion to maintain adequate free cash flow and growth to support its obligations ￼. As a private company, Asurion does not publicly report margins, but anecdotally its EBITDA was reported around $1.5–$2 billion in recent years (implied by industry analysts), giving it some cushion.

It’s worth noting Asurion surrendered a state job-creation grant in 2025 as its Nashville headcount fell short (due to layoffs and remote work) ￼. This indicates the company has been cutting costs and reorganizing in the past couple of years – likely an effort to improve efficiency and profitability. In mid-2024, for example, the company confirmed “hundreds” of layoffs (a “small percentage” of the workforce) as part of continuous optimization ￼. Despite such turbulence, Asurion’s 2023 rebound (9% revenue growth) and 2024 stability suggest it has largely recovered from the big 2020 client loss and pandemic-era challenges ￼.

2024 & H1 2025 Highlights (Deals and Performance): In lieu of public earnings calls, Asurion’s press releases provide insight into recent performance:
	•	Q4 2023 – Q1 2024: Asurion secured major contract renewals with top carriers (extending partnerships well into the 2030s) ￼. It also inked a significant platform partnership with Reach (Aug 2024) to offer its device protection through dozens of regional telecom operators ￼ ￼ – effectively “closed-won” a deal giving access to 40M potential new customers via Reach’s MVNE platform. Internally, late 2023 saw a leadership change: long-time CEO Tony Detter transitioned out, and Asurion’s board elevated Tim Stadthaus to CEO in Nov 2023 ￼. Stadthaus (previously a senior executive) inherited a “giant seeking a rebound” ￼, and under his early tenure, Asurion’s trajectory turned positive. By Q1 2024, revenue and earnings were climbing back, according to a Moody’s analysis, after the prior hits ￼. (As an aside, Moody’s had noted Asurion’s revenue fell ~18% around 2020–2021 when it lost the Sprint/T-Mobile contract, but has since recovered with ~9% growth in 2023 ￼.)
	•	Full-Year 2024: Asurion ended 2024 around $9.3B in revenue ￼ with a diversified client base. Notable “closed-won” contracts in 2024 likely include the Reach deal, renewing Verizon/AT&T (multi-billion dollar accounts), and expanding device protection to new partners like Spectrum Mobile or Xfinity Mobile (hypothetical examples – not explicitly announced, but Reach covers many cable operators). Asurion also continued to invest in product innovation (e.g. piloting new trade-in solutions and integrating AI into support). While exact profit figures aren’t public, S&P noted Asurion’s EBITDA and free cash flow have been sufficient to modestly reduce debt, a positive sign ￼.
	•	Q1 2025: Asurion reported a “strong start” to 2025 with growth momentum and expanded partnerships ￼. In the first quarter alone, it: extended long-term contracts with two major wireless carriers (ensuring those revenue streams are secure) ￼; launched device protection for Breezeline Mobile (a new carrier client) ￼; and won new business from tech giants – becoming the authorized repair provider for Xbox and Surface devices (Microsoft) ￼ and being selected by Google to run the Preferred Care warranty for Pixel phones ￼. Each of these deals can be seen as a “win” against competitors and will contribute to future revenue. Asurion’s CEO Tim Stadthaus highlighted that such extensions and new partnerships “are the best testaments to the value we deliver” ￼. Financially, though no Q1 revenue figure was given, these developments suggest organic growth in 2025. Asurion also strengthened its leadership team (hiring a new Chief HR Officer in March 2025) and earned workplace accolades (100% score on HRC Equality Index, 8th straight Great Place to Work certification) ￼ – indicative that the company is investing in its people even as it grows.
	•	Q2 2025: In the second quarter, Asurion continued its expansion. A headline partnership was with Blue Stream Fiber (June 2025), whereby Asurion rolled out tech support and multi-device protection offerings to Blue Stream’s internet customers ￼ ￼. Essentially, Asurion gained another regional ISP client, packaging its Advanced Tech Care and device coverage into Blue Stream’s service lineup. Also in Q2, Asurion and Cricket Wireless launched the new always-on trade-in program (announced April 7, 2025) ￼, which likely drives incremental revenue through resale of used devices and encourages customers to upgrade more frequently (benefiting Cricket/AT&T and Asurion’s supply chain business). Another Q2 highlight: Asurion was recognized in the UK with its second “Best Insurance Partner” award at the Mobile News Awards ￼, underscoring international performance (the UK award reflects its successful device insurance programs with European carriers). Financially, Asurion’s H1 2025 performance seems on target with expectations – continuing contract renewals and new client wins support the modest revenue growth outlook. We don’t have exact H1 revenue, but given the narrative, the company is tracking toward its projected 2025 growth. It’s reasonable to project full-year 2025 revenue in the $9.5–9.7B range (hypothesis), assuming these new deals ramp up and no major client losses occur.

(The above performance summary cites Asurion press releases for factual events: contract extensions ￼, new partnerships like Breezeline ￼, Blue Stream ￼, Google ￼, Cricket trade-in ￼, and awards ￼. Financial numbers ($9.1B, $9.3B) are from credible reports ￼ ￼. Forward-looking revenue figures are labeled as projections based on these facts and the S&P guidance.)

Debt Profile and Ownership: As mentioned, Asurion’s capital structure is highly leveraged. It has a multi-tier debt stack (first-lien term loans, second-lien loans, etc.) stemming from the 2007 buyout and subsequent refinancings. A notable historical data point: in 2018, Asurion’s total term loans outstanding reached $11.3 billion after a large dividend recapitalization ￼. By 2025, the company has refinanced some of these (e.g. issuing new term loans due 2028) and paid down a portion, improving the recovery prospects for senior lenders ￼. Still, Asurion likely carries over $10 billion in debt today, which incurs a substantial interest expense. The credit ratings (B1/B+) reflect a balanced view – Asurion has stable cash flows and a dominant market position, but also “aggressive financial leverage” and the risk that comes with being PE-owned (including a history of borrowing to fund shareholder payouts) ￼.

It’s important for a potential employee or interviewer to understand this context: the company’s strategic decisions (expanding services, seeking new markets like smart home support) are partly driven by the need to grow revenue and EBITDA to manage that debt load. For example, the Reach partnership in 2024 was explicitly touted as creating a “turnkey revenue stream” for small operators ￼ ￼ – and by extension, it’s a new revenue stream for Asurion as well. The company’s ownership (as of recent years) includes the original PE sponsors (Madison Dearborn, Providence, etc.) reportedly now holding <30% combined after some secondary sales ￼, alongside other institutional investors like CPPIB (Canada Pension Plan) and sovereign funds that have taken stakes. This ownership explains the focus on EBITDA, efficiency, and long-term contracts (common priorities in PE-backed firms).

(Sources used: Wolf Street article for 2018 debt and leverage ￼, S&P snippet for debt reduction and rating ￼, Nashville Biz Journal for context on PE ownership changes ￼. The linkage of strategy to debt is an analytic inference, not a stated fact – I’ve labeled it as context for the reader.)

Company Culture and Nashville Office Life

Asurion’s company culture emphasizes innovation, inclusivity, and customer-centricity – with a dash of Nashville flavor. The firm’s motto of “We don’t just fix tech – we fix frustration” speaks to a culture focused on solving problems for people ￼. Internally, Asurion promotes values of optimism, empathy, and teamwork, calling its workforce “23,000 people, one team” worldwide ￼. The company has earned recognition as a Great Place to Work (certified 8 years running) and scored 100% on the Human Rights Campaign’s Corporate Equality Index in 2025 for LGBTQ+ inclusion ￼. Employee Resource Groups and diversity initiatives are active, indicating a modern, inclusive workplace ￼ ￼.

Nashville Headquarters: Asurion’s global headquarters is in the Gulch neighborhood of downtown Nashville, in a brand-new campus opened in 2021 ￼. The HQ was designed to be state-of-the-art and reflect local culture. Initially, Asurion anticipated a growing in-office workforce there. However, in the post-2020 era, the company has embraced flexible and remote work arrangements to a significant degree. By 2025, Asurion actually subleased three of its Gulch office floors to WeWork (about 98,000 sq. ft.) because many employees were working remotely and local headcount had shrunk ￼. This is a telling sign: despite the beautiful office space, Asurion found it was not utilizing all of it due to hybrid work trends. In fact, the company ended a Tennessee state job-creation grant in 2025 because it didn’t meet the planned number of onsite new jobs, owing to “a few years of turbulence” and shifts in workforce strategy ￼.

For an employee in the Nashville office, this means the environment is likely hybrid-friendly and not heavily rigid about daily attendance. The work-from-home flexibility is high – Asurion’s career site explicitly says “we offer a flexible work environment… whether they’re at the office or on the screen”, enabling employees to thrive “no matter the time zone” ￼ ￼. The company promotes work-life balance, citing flexible schedules, hybrid work options, generous PTO, parental leave, and even pet insurance as perks ￼ ￼. This aligns with employee feedback on forums: Asurion’s return-to-office policy is described as fully flexible (employee choice) rather than mandated days – essentially 0% of roles require 5 days in office according to one culture survey (Comparably) and ~100% are either hybrid or remote by choice (a stark contrast to many firms) (Hypothesis, based on reported employee anecdotes).

Work Attire: The office culture at Asurion is tech-casual. There isn’t a published dress code on official sites, but given the company’s tech orientation and emphasis on inclusion, one can infer that business casual or casual attire is the norm. (On a typical day at the Nashville HQ, you’d likely see jeans, company-logo t-shirts or polos, and a generally relaxed dress environment.) This aligns with the vibe of “employees being themselves and feeling they belong” that Asurion touts ￼. Formal suits would be rare except perhaps for client meetings or executive presentations. *(This is a reasoned hypothesis – Asurion doesn’t state “dress code = casual” outright, but tech companies in Nashville and Asurion’s cultural messaging strongly suggest it.)

Work-Life Balance: Asurion appears to genuinely value WLB, though experiences vary by role. The official stance: “[we] promote a balanced work life” and encourage wellbeing through wellness programs ￼. Many roles have flexible hours, and the company provides ample PTO (one source noted they often have an unlimited PTO policy, though that may depend on position) ￼ ￼. In the technical and corporate roles, employees likely enjoy a lot of autonomy in managing their schedule. However, it’s worth noting that some Asurion roles are in call centers or retail (uBreakiFix stores), which may have more structured hours. Overall, Asurion’s average employee ratings for work-life balance hover around 3.1 out of 5 on Indeed ￼ – indicating decent but not exceptional WLB in practice. This suggests that while the company policies support balance, the fast-paced nature of tech services (and perhaps occasional spikes in claim volumes or product launches) can make workloads heavy at times. In an interview context, you could mention that you value the company’s stated commitment to flexibility and would thrive in that self-directed environment.

Employee Feedback: Employees often praise the ability to learn new things, the “supportive environment,” and fair pay at Asurion ￼. The compensation and benefits are considered competitive – e.g. a Technical Support rep role might pay above industry average, and corporate roles offer market-rate salaries with 401k match (after 1 year) ￼ and solid health insurance. Asurion has been on Forbes’ lists of best employers (e.g. #661 on America’s Best Large Employers 2025, and named among Best Employers for Tech Workers) ￼, which reflects a positive overall employee sentiment. That said, areas of improvement noted by employees include communication and “management transparency” in times of change ￼. The company went through some layoffs and reorgs in 2023–24, which always rattles morale. Notably, there were public allegations of a toxic manager and HR issues in 2023, which the CEO addressed in an all-hands town hall ￼. Asurion took those concerns seriously and even saw the exit of a board chairman and an ex-CEO from leadership roles around that time ￼. So, it seems Asurion’s culture, while strong, is not without the occasional growing pain. Bringing this up in an interview (tactfully) could show you’re aware of the company’s human side – e.g. “I read that Asurion has taken steps to continuously evolve its culture and address internal feedback; it’s great to see a company that listens and strives to improve.”

In Nashville specifically, Asurion is a prominent tech employer and is often involved in the local community. The headquarters being downtown means employees have access to the vibrant Gulch area (restaurants, etc.), and Asurion has sponsored local events and charities. If you’re joining the Nashville office, you’ll likely work in a modern open-concept space with lots of collaboration areas – designed for “activity-based working.” But you’ll also enjoy the freedom to work from home frequently. Many Nashville employees do a hybrid schedule (e.g. 2-3 days in office for meetings/collaboration, and the rest remote), unless their job explicitly requires on-site presence. Asurion’s own career page highlights that “our people stay connected, whether they’re at the office or on the screen” ￼, which encapsulates the flexible ethos.

(Sources: Company career page for flexibility ￼ ￼; press for subleasing HQ space ￼; Indeed reviews for work-life balance metric ￼. Comments on attire and specific hybrid practices are informed hypotheses based on company culture descriptions ￼ and general tech industry norms.)

Leadership Team (Nashville-Based Personnel)

Asurion’s executive leadership is largely based in Nashville and brings experience across tech, telecom, and services. Here are key leaders (with their roles and departments) as of 2025:
	•	Kevin Taweel – Executive Chairman (Co-Founder): Kevin co-founded Asurion in 1994 and served as CEO for many years. He now serves as Executive Chairman of the Board ￼. While not in day-to-day operations, he’s an active leader guiding strategy and culture. (Department: Board/Corporate – as Chairman, he oversees high-level governance. Formerly he led the company’s overall operations.) Taweel is known for championing Asurion’s long-term vision; under his leadership the company grew from 40 employees to over 20,000 ￼. Fun fact: In 2021, he stepped back from the CEO role (Tony Detter succeeded him then), and in 2023 he re-engaged as Executive Chair when Detter moved to a board role ￼. Kevin Taweel’s success is evident – he recently purchased a $17.5M home in Beverly Hills ￼, reflecting the wealth generated from Asurion’s growth (and private equity deals).
	•	Tim Stadthaus – Chief Executive Officer: Tim Stadthaus is the current CEO (effective November 2023) ￼. Previously, he held senior roles at Asurion (exact background not publicly detailed, but likely in operations or client services). As CEO, Stadthaus oversees all departments – from sales and product to finance and technology – and is steering Asurion’s “tech care” strategy forward. His focus in 2024–25 has been on expanding partnerships and evolving Asurion into a “Service Experience Platform” (a term Asurion uses to describe its next-gen integrated service technology) ￼. Stadthaus operates out of the Nashville HQ and reports to the Board (incl. Taweel). (Department: Executive Management.) In Q1 2025 press, Tim was quoted about continually “earning the right to evolve the tech care experience” alongside partners ￼ – indicating his emphasis on innovation and customer experience.
	•	David Baga – President, Enterprise & Consumer: David Baga is responsible for Asurion’s core business lines that serve both enterprise partners and direct consumers ￼. In essence, he likely heads sales, client management, and perhaps product strategy for all service offerings. Baga’s role (“President, Enterprise and Consumer”) suggests he oversees the teams that interface with carrier partners (enterprise clients) as well as any consumer-facing channels. This could include sales, account management, marketing, and the development of service offerings for those segments. (Department: Go-To-Market/Sales/Product.) Baga presumably reports to the CEO and drives revenue growth across Asurion’s partner network. (Background: Before Asurion, David Baga had leadership stints at Lyft and Rocket Lawyer, focusing on go-to-market – that business savvy is what he brings to Asurion’s partner-focused approach.)
	•	Cindy Christy – President, Core Connect: Cindy leads the “Core Connect” organization ￼, which appears to encompass Asurion’s device lifecycle services – e.g. supply chain, trade-in, repair, and perhaps customer care operations. In a Cricket trade-in press release, Cindy is quoted as “Asurion President of Core Connect” discussing how trade-in and keeping devices in use longer also benefits the environment ￼. From that, we infer Core Connect covers supply chain & logistics, warranty fulfillment, and eco-initiatives – essentially the operational backbone of Asurion’s services (connecting customers with solutions). Christy is a telecom industry veteran (she was once President of Sprint’s Nextel Communications). (Department: Operations/Infrastructure.) Under her purview, Asurion’s claims processing, repair network, and distribution centers likely fall. Cindy’s insight on leveraging Asurion’s “unmatched supply chain” in the Cricket program ￼ shows her focus on efficiency and service delivery.
	•	Todd Chretien – Chief Customer Officer (CCO): Todd is in charge of customer experience and service quality across Asurion’s offerings ￼. As CCO, he likely oversees call center operations, customer support strategy (including the Tech Help team), and customer journey improvements. His role indicates Asurion’s commitment to having a C-level voice of the customer. Todd’s team would work on metrics like Net Promoter Score, claim satisfaction, and making the service experience “effortless” (as Asurion aspires). (Department: Customer Experience/Service Ops.)
	•	Pablo Brizi – Chief Human Resources Officer (CHRO): Pablo joined Asurion in March 2025 to lead HR and people strategy ￼. He has 25+ years of global HR experience and is tasked with cultivating a diverse, innovative workplace ￼. Brizi’s scope covers talent acquisition, development programs (Asurion notably invests in leadership training, such as partnerships with local universities ￼), compensation & benefits, and employee relations. (Department: Human Resources.) His addition to the team in 2025 shows Asurion’s focus on culture during growth – he reports directly to the CEO and ensures the people strategy aligns with business goals.
	•	Andrea (Magyera) Jimenez – Chief Financial Officer (CFO): Andrea manages Asurion’s finances, including FP&A, accounting, and likely investor relations with the private equity owners ￼. She oversees financial strategy – budgeting for new initiatives, managing that large debt load, and guiding profitability. Andrea has been with Asurion in finance roles for years and became CFO around 2022. (Department: Finance.) In a heavily leveraged company, her role is critical in balancing investment in innovation with debt obligations. She likely is the point person for rating agency meetings and bank negotiations as well. (We can expect her to be ensuring the modest growth in 2025 translates to better margins and cash flow.)
	•	Gus Puryear – General Counsel: Gus is Asurion’s top lawyer, overseeing all legal, compliance, and regulatory matters ￼. His team handles things like consumer compliance (insurance is regulated at state levels, for instance), intellectual property, contracts with partners, and litigation. Puryear also likely advises on government relations – e.g. Asurion has to navigate state insurance licensing, data privacy laws, etc. (Department: Legal.) Gus has a background in both corporate law and previously served as a federal judicial nominee; he’s been with Asurion for a number of years steering its legal strategy during the company’s global expansion.
	•	Pardha Reddy – Chief Technology Officer (CTO): Pardha leads Asurion’s technology and engineering organization ￼. This includes software development (for claims systems, customer apps, internal tools), IT infrastructure, and emerging tech like AI/ML integration into support. Under Pardha’s leadership, Asurion is transforming its platform – as noted in the Technical Solutions Architect job post, the company is building a “Service Experience Platform” that unifies its services and leverages AI ￼. The CTO’s team is responsible for scalability, security (important when handling millions of customer data points), and tech innovation to keep Asurion competitive. (Department: Technology/Product Development.) Pardha likely works closely with Product Management and with the Customer Officer to ensure the tech meets customer needs.
	•	Senior Vice Presidents (SVPs) and Other Notables: In addition to the C-suite, Asurion has SVPs heading specific domains:
	•	Rodney Schlosser – SVP, Business Development & Strategic Partnerships: Rodney leads the team that wins new clients and negotiates deals ￼. For example, he was quoted in the Breezeline partnership release as the executive closing that deal, emphasizing delivering “fast, reliable device protection” to Breezeline customers ￼. He likely oversees the Sales/GTM organization (so the Technical Solutions Architect (TSA) role might dotted-line into his org, more on that below). Rodney’s remit is expanding Asurion’s partner network (e.g. signing new carriers, retailers, OEMs).
	•	John Leonard – SVP, Enterprise Partner Growth: John likely focuses on growing revenue with existing partners and onboarding new services for them ￼. His title suggests a focus on enterprise clients (carriers, etc.), ensuring Asurion’s accounts (like AT&T, Verizon) keep expanding what they buy from Asurion.
	•	Jeff Connell and Vicky Klein – SVPs, Client Services/Marketing: Jeff is SVP of Client Services & Marketing ￼, and Vicky is SVP of Client Services ￼. They likely split responsibilities for managing partner relationships and marketing programs. For instance, one might handle carrier accounts and the other retail/OEM accounts, or perhaps one focuses on international vs domestic. They ensure Asurion meets SLA’s, hits customer satisfaction targets for each partner, and that marketing efforts (like promoting trade-in programs or new device protection features) are effective. Jeff’s inclusion of “& Marketing” in title indicates he oversees Asurion’s marketing communications and consumer insights as well.
	•	John Knoch – SVP, Regional CEO: John Knoch is listed as “Regional CEO (SVP)” ￼ – likely meaning he heads a geographic division (possibly Asurion’s International segment or a region like Asia-Pacific). For example, Asurion Japan’s CEO (Michael Dailey) is on the exec team separately ￼, and John Knoch might oversee another region or a portion of global operations outside the Americas.
	•	Michael Dailey – CEO, Japan (SVP level): Michael leads Asurion’s business in Japan ￼, which is one of Asurion’s largest international markets (Asurion has major contracts with Japanese carriers for phone insurance). His presence on the global exec team shows how important Japan is to the company.

These leaders are predominantly based in Nashville (with the exception of regional roles like Dailey in Tokyo). The Nashville HQ houses the core C-suite and many of their teams. One can expect, for example, to bump into Tim Stadthaus or David Baga in the halls (or at least see them in all-hands meetings).

Reporting structure hypothesis for TSA role: The user specifically asked which department the Technical Solutions Architect (TSA) role would report into. Based on the job description, the TSA is “embedded in the GTM (Go-To-Market) team” ￼ and works closely with Sales, Business Development, and Product/Engineering to craft solutions for clients. This strongly suggests the TSA sits under the Sales/Business Development organization (GTM), rather than under the pure engineering org. The SVP of Business Development (Rodney Schlosser) or the President of Enterprise & Consumer (David Baga) could be upstream in this reporting line. The job is essentially a pre-sales technical consultant role – the TSA partners with account teams to win deals and ensure Asurion’s platform can meet client requirements ￼ ￼. So it’s logical the TSA reports into the GTM/Sales division (possibly within Rodney’s Strategic Partnerships team, or a specialized Sales Engineering group). We can confidently say it’s not a pure IT/internal architecture role, but a client-facing technical sales support role, likely under the umbrella of Commercial or Product Solutions. In LinkedIn’s listing, the job function is tagged as “Engineering and IT” but that likely speaks to the skillset, not the org chart ￼. The description explicitly mentions collaborating with Sales and BD and influencing Product teams ￼ ￼. So our hypothesis: the Technical Solutions Architect will report up through the Go-to-Market (Commercial) organization, possibly under a VP of Solutions Engineering or directly under an SVP in charge of Partner Solutions. This is something you could clarify in an interview, but framing it as “I understand the TSA role is embedded in GTM, working cross-functionally with sales and product – likely reporting into the partnerships side of the house?” would show you’ve done your homework.

Leadership Salaries (Hypothesis): Because Asurion is private, exact executive compensation isn’t disclosed publicly. We can only infer based on company size and industry benchmarks. As a $9B revenue company, one of the largest in its field, it’s likely that top executives earn multi-million dollar annual compensation packages. For example, a CEO of a comparable public tech/service company might earn a base salary in the seven figures and total compensation (with bonus/stock) well into the $5–10+ million range annually. Since Asurion’s executives often have equity stakes (through the private equity owners’ incentive plans), their wealth can be significant – co-founder Kevin Taweel, for instance, is clearly very wealthy (e.g. his $17.5M home purchase implies substantial net worth) ￼. Rank-and-file execs (like Presidents or SVPs) likely have total comps in the high six to low seven figures. These figures are conjectural – Asurion doesn’t file proxy statements. But given Asurion’s sale transactions and dividends, key executives probably have profited from those as well. For instance, when Asurion borrowed $3.75B for a shareholder payout in 2018, some executives/owners would have received part of that distribution ￼ ￼.

So, in summary (hypothesis): CEO pay is likely on par with large public-company CEOs (maybe ~$5M+ per year). Other C-suite members might be in the $1M+ range each (base salary plus bonuses). Leaders of Asurion’s size also often participate in long-term incentive plans that could pay out tens of millions if the company is sold or hits certain valuations. Since Asurion was rumored in the past to consider an IPO or ownership changes, those incentives exist. Again, none of this is confirmed by the company – but being aware that Asurion’s top execs are very well-compensated (and thus under pressure to deliver results) gives context. One factual nugget: Asurion has appeared on Forbes lists like “America’s Best Employers,” but not on public lists of CEO pay (since private).

(Sources: Leadership names and titles are directly from Asurion’s official Leadership page ￼ ￼ ￼, and press releases for quotes by those leaders (e.g. Schlosser in Breezeline PR ￼, Christy in Cricket PR ￼). The reporting structure for TSA is inferred from the LinkedIn job description ￼ – I’ve clearly marked that as a hypothesis. Salary discussions are entirely hypothesis, using contextual clues like Taweel’s home purchase ￼ and industry norms; I flagged these as conjecture.)

Competitors and Market Position

Asurion operates at the intersection of insurance, tech support, and consumer electronics services – and thus has a unique set of competitors in each area. Understanding the competitive landscape is useful for strategic conversations:
	•	Mobile Device Insurance Competitors: The primary rival is Assurant, Inc., a Fortune 500 insurer that also provides mobile protection plans and extended service contracts. Assurant is actually the provider for Asurion’s biggest lost client (T-Mobile/Sprint). In 2020, when T-Mobile acquired Sprint, T-Mobile chose to stick with Assurant, causing Asurion to lose that contract – a big hit. Assurant’s “Global Lifestyle” unit (which includes mobile device protection) is very active; they process millions of devices a year and have a large operation in the Nashville area too ￼. In late 2023 Assurant announced expansion of its local device processing center to handle 18 million devices a year (more than doubling space) ￼ – a sign that they are aggressively growing in trade-in and repair, directly encroaching on Asurion’s turf. Assurant’s key clients include T-Mobile (USA), DISH (Boost Mobile), and many international carriers. Like Asurion, Assurant also offers extended warranties for appliances and electronics. The two companies are often considered duopolists in the U.S. mobile protection market. Difference: Asurion has its own retail repair arm (uBreakiFix), whereas Assurant tends to partner with repair franchises (e.g. Assurant owns a chain called CPR – Cell Phone Repair – and leverages third-party repair depots). Both are innovating in trade-in solutions and smartphone upgrade programs, competing to sign carriers and OEMs for those services.
	•	Extended Warranty Providers: In the broader device and appliance protection arena, Asurion competes with Allstate’s SquareTrade. SquareTrade (acquired by Allstate in 2017) historically sold device protection direct to consumers (e.g. via Amazon, Costco, Sam’s Club). It’s a well-known brand for electronics warranties – for instance, many people bought SquareTrade plans for TVs or laptops. Allstate has been integrating SquareTrade into its offerings (rebranding some as “Allstate Protection Plans”). Amazon was a major SquareTrade partner, but with Asurion’s new Complete Protect on Amazon ￼, Asurion is now directly competing and possibly displacing some of SquareTrade’s business. SquareTrade’s differentiator was a direct-to-consumer approach and a slick online claims experience; Asurion, however, has caught up on digital claims and offers a far more in-person repair network than SquareTrade can. Other warranty competitors include Assurant (again, as they also do appliance/electronics coverage), and smaller players like Upsie (a startup offering cheap direct-to-consumer warranties via an app) or AKKO (which has a subscription model for phone + electronics protection, somewhat akin to Asurion Home+). These smaller InsurTechs market heavily to millennials, but they lack the scale and partner integration Asurion has. In retail and OEM channels, Asurion’s merger with NEW in 2008 made it a powerhouse – historically, NEW serviced warranties for retailers like Best Buy, Walmart, and Lowe’s. (Best Buy’s Geek Squad Protection was once backed by NEW, which became Asurion ￼, though Best Buy later brought a lot in-house). TL;DR: In selling protection plans at point-of-sale, Asurion often vies with Allstate/SquareTrade and Assurant for contracts.
	•	Tech Support Services: For Asurion’s tech help and on-demand support, competitors include Best Buy Geek Squad (for in-home tech support and installation) and Apple’s AppleCare/Support (for Apple device troubleshooting – though AppleCare is also insurance-like). However, in the telco space, the main competitor was Sprint’s/now T-Mobile’s “Tech21” support which was actually powered by Assurant’s acquisition of Soluto’s rival. Interestingly, Asurion’s acquisition of Soluto gave it an edge in remote tech support apps, which competitors have tried to emulate. Another competitor is Hyperlink (formerly Enjoy Technology) – a startup that did in-home device setup (led by a former Apple exec); though Enjoy filed bankruptcy in 2022, remnants of that model persist. Also, device OEMs and platforms (Amazon, Google) have their own support ecosystems that indirectly compete (e.g. Amazon has “Amazon Expert” services, Apple has Genius Bar). Yet, Asurion often partners with those OEMs rather than purely competing – e.g. Asurion runs Google’s support/warranty now, and it provides Premier Support for AT&T and Verizon customers which competes with Apple’s own support to an extent. In summary, Asurion’s tech support faces mostly fragmented competition: local IT repair shops, Geek Squad, carrier in-house support teams, etc., but few can match Asurion’s scale and multi-device expertise.
	•	Repair Services: Through uBreakiFix, Asurion is competing with independent repair shops and emerging chains. CPR (Cell Phone Repair) is one chain (which is actually now owned by Assurant). Best Buy’s Geek Squad does some repairs (mostly via mail-in or in-store for PCs and phones at Best Buy locations). Then there are manufacturer-owned channels: e.g. Apple’s own stores and authorized providers compete for iPhone repair traffic, Samsung’s partnership with uBreakiFix gives Asurion a leg up for Samsung devices, etc. So Asurion is quite strong here – it essentially is the competitor to beat in local electronics repair now, given uBreakiFix’s nationwide footprint. If anything, one could argue Apple and Samsung’s increasing support for DIY or their own service programs (like Apple’s Self-Service Repair program or Samsung’s Authorized Service Centers) is a trend to watch, but Asurion is often involved as an authorized party anyway.
	•	Insurance Industry: One might consider that Asurion (and Assurant) face indirect competition from traditional insurance (e.g. some people opt for coverage via credit card benefits or homeowners insurance riders for phones), but those are not specialized and often have high deductibles. The specialized InsurTech startups for device coverage, as mentioned (Upsie, AKKO), are probably the most direct small challengers, often marketing lower prices. However, they lack Asurion’s service delivery capabilities (they often will just reimburse you or mail you a box – they don’t have stores or instant replacements like Asurion’s system).

Competitive Advantages: Asurion’s competitive edge lies in its integrated model and partner network. It is deeply embedded with carriers and retailers – those relationships are hard for newcomers to break. It also owns the supply chain and repair network, meaning it can fulfill claims faster and often at lower cost (since it does refurbishment in-house, etc.) ￼. For example, neither Upsie nor SquareTrade has physical repair centers – they would reimburse or outsource repairs. Asurion’s ability to send you to a local uBreakiFix or dispatch a tech to your home same-day is a differentiator that competitors find expensive to match. Additionally, Asurion’s long history means tons of data on device failure rates, which helps in pricing and AI-driven support (the company likely uses machine learning to assist customers – possibly an interview talking point: their use of AI for predictive troubleshooting or claim fraud detection).

Global Perspective: Globally, Asurion competes with some regional players. In Europe, companies like Likewize (formerly Brightstar’s insurance arm) and CPP Group compete in device insurance. In Asia, local insurance companies sometimes partner with carriers (e.g. in China or India, Asurion might face local insurers or in-house telco solutions). However, Asurion has a presence in 14+ countries and often is the market leader when it operates there ￼. For instance, in Japan, Asurion is the dominant provider through partnerships with carriers like KDDI; in Latin America, it partnered with América Móvil to reach millions of customers ￼. If asked globally, you can mention that domestically Asurion’s main competitor is Assurant, and internationally it varies – e.g. Likewize, local firms, or sometimes the carrier’s self-run program. But Asurion is unique in being truly global with a consistent model.

In an interview, showing awareness of competitors is great. You might say, for example: “I understand Asurion’s chief competitor in the mobile protection space is Assurant – who notably took over the T-Mobile account in 2020 – and that competition drives Asurion to differentiate with even better service and innovation. I also see Allstate’s SquareTrade in the extended warranty arena, and smaller startups like Upsie trying to nip at the edges. However, Asurion’s end-to-end capabilities (from support to repair logistics) seem unparalleled, which is exciting to me as someone who would be crafting solutions leveraging those strengths.” This shows you grasp the landscape and Asurion’s selling points.

(Sources: BizJournal article referencing Assurant’s device volume ￼, Wolf Street for private equity context ￼, Wikipedia for global operations ￼. Knowledge of SquareTrade/Allstate is general industry knowledge (SquareTrade was widely reported as acquired by Allstate). Competitor names Upsie, AKKO are from search results listing top competitors ￼. These competitor insights are factual to the extent of their existence and relationship, but any qualitative comparison (“Asurion is better at X”) is an analytical take based on cited capabilities – I’ve phrased it to clearly indicate it’s observational/hypothetical.)

Conversation Pointers for the Interview

Finally, with all this information, here are some suggested talking points and questions you could use in your interview to demonstrate your deep understanding and enthusiasm:
	•	Broad Knowledge of Asurion: *“I’m impressed by how Asurion has evolved from a cell phone insurance company into a full *‘tech care’ provider covering everything from smartphones to refrigerators ￼. That end-to-end approach – insurance, support, repair, trade-in – is exactly what modern customers need. I find that holistic model very compelling.” – This shows you get the “full breadth” of the company. You can mention key products: “For instance, I love that Asurion Home+ can cover all my home gadgets under one plan ￼, and that if something breaks I might even get same-day help through uBreakiFix – not many competitors can say that.”
	•	Recent Wins and Momentum: “Congratulations on the recent partnerships – I read about Asurion extending contracts with major wireless carriers and winning Google’s warranty program ￼ ￼. Those are huge wins. It tells me Asurion’s partners trust the company to deliver, which is a great sign for the future.” – Referencing the Q1 2025 press release shows you keep up with Asurion news. You could follow up by asking, “How does the Technical Solutions Architect role contribute to making these partnerships successful? For example, in onboarding a new partner like Breezeline Mobile, would a TSA be involved in designing the integration of Asurion’s protection platform with Breezeline’s systems?” – This connects your understanding to the role you’re applying for.
	•	Understanding the TSA Role in Context: “From the job description, it sounds like the Technical Solutions Architect is part of the Go-to-Market team, working cross-functionally with Sales, Product, and Engineering to tailor solutions ￼. I thrive in roles where I can bridge business needs with technical execution. Could you tell me about an example project a TSA has handled recently? Perhaps designing a solution for a new client in the smart home space or customizing the platform for an international carrier?” – This question both shows you know what department you’re in (GTM) and invites the interviewer to share specifics. It subtly confirms your hypothesis that TSA is aligned with sales/BD (which it is, per description).
	•	Mentioning Competitors Thoughtfully: “Asurion seems to consistently outpace competitors like Assurant or SquareTrade in terms of the breadth of services. For instance, not only can you replace a phone next-day, but you also operate hundreds of repair stores ￼ – that’s a differentiator. In my view, this comprehensive capability is a big selling point to partners who could choose a competitor. Is articulating these competitive advantages part of the TSA’s role when engaging with prospective clients?” – This shows you’re thinking about competitive positioning and the TSA’s part in sales strategy. It also name-drops competitors in a knowledgeable way (be sure to do so respectfully, as you did, focusing on Asurion’s strengths).
	•	Financial/Business Acumen: You could comment (cautiously) on Asurion’s scale and private status: “I realize Asurion is a private company backed by private equity, which often means a strong focus on growth and profitability. I’m excited by that because it means the company is both entrepreneurial and results-driven. I saw that revenue in 2024 was around $9.3B ￼, with expectations of growth this year – it’s clearly a robust business. I’m curious, how does the Product & Engineering side (where I’d contribute) balance innovation with the company’s need to meet financial targets? In the TSA role, I imagine we’d need to propose solutions that are not only technically sound but also cost-effective for Asurion and the client.” – This illustrates you understand the business context (debt, growth pressure) and are thinking about sustainable solutions, not just “cool tech.”
	•	Culture and Working Style: “I was happy to see Asurion’s emphasis on flexible work and employee well-being ￼ ￼. That’s important to me. The Nashville hub looks amazing from the photos – though I heard you even subleased some space because so many folks work hybrid now ￼! In the TSA position, will I have the option to work remotely part of the time? And how does the team typically collaborate – via virtual meetings, periodic in-person design sessions, etc.?” – This signals you’ve done your research (mentioning the sublease news casually) and value the work-life balance they claim to offer. It’s a reasonable, informed question about day-to-day work.
	•	Future of Tech Care: “Asurion is positioning itself as a Service Experience Platform provider ￼. To me, that sounds like an evolution to a more software-driven, AI-enhanced service delivery – moving from just reacting to tech issues to proactively managing devices for customers. I’m excited about that vision. Could you share more about what that entails? For instance, is Asurion building a unified platform that partners plug into, and will the TSA help customize that platform for each partner’s needs?” – This shows forward-thinking. You directly pull the phrasing from the job post, indicating you read it carefully. And you cast it in visionary terms (proactive, AI, etc.), which invites the interviewer to discuss strategy. As a TSA, demonstrating interest in the product/platform evolution is key.
	•	Personal Experience or Story (if applicable): If you have ever used Asurion’s services as a customer (many have, for phone claims or a uBreakiFix repair), you might mention: “I’m actually a satisfied Asurion customer myself – I had my phone replaced through Verizon’s Asurion program last year and the experience was seamless. It impressed me and is part of why I applied. I’d love to help continue that level of service for others.” This can create a personal connection. If you haven’t personally, you could reference a friend’s story or even one of the use cases from press releases: “I saw a story about Asurion helping a customer get their cracked phone screen fixed the same day – at a coffee shop no less ￼. Those kind of ‘wow’ experiences are what make me want to be on this team.”

Each of these points ties back to facts or context we’ve discussed, showing you’re well-prepared and insightful. Of course, tailor them to your own style. The goal is to demonstrate industry awareness (competitors, market trends), knowledge of Asurion’s business (products, partners, financial scale), and an understanding of how your role fits into that picture (GTM team, pre-sales technical role). By doing so, you position yourself as someone who is not just technically capable but also business savvy and culturally aligned with Asurion’s mission to “help people and their tech” ￼. Good luck in the interview!
