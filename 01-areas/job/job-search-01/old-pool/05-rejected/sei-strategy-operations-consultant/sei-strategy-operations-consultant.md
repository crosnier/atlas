SEI - Strategy and Operations Consultant

**WHO WE LOOK FOR**

An SEI-er is a master communicator and active listener who understands how to navigate an audience. Self-aware, almost to a fault, SEI-ers keenly understand how to adjust their support and problem solving based on the situation. Following a logical, fact-based approach, SEI-ers possess the superior ability to see correlations others may not, ask the right questions and drive solutions. 

As super-connectors, they connect not only people, but data, trends and experiences. Mature, humble, and genuine, SEI-ers frequently go above and beyond for both their clients and their colleagues. SEI-ers are ethical and trustworthy individuals who consistently and repeatedly follow through, and hold true to their values in difficult situations. SEI-ers have an insatiable curiosity and love to learn. These individuals are commonly tech savvy and early adopters. Their passion for learning is infectious and excites others. As every project is different, an SEI-er must be adaptable and comfortable with unexpected situations. SEI-ers define ambition differently. They are authentic, low-maintenance individuals who truly enjoy one another- they like to hang out with colleagues outside of work, collaborate and hold one another accountable. SEI-ers enjoy working with genuine, thoughtful folks who want to steer clear of the traditional grind and share the joy of day-to-day life and activities with colleagues, friends, and family. 

**WHAT WE DO**

Our Strategy and Operations consultants work with clients at all levels of the organization, from the C-suite to the shop floor, helping them to deliver on their most strategic initiatives. We’re known for making realistic, data-driven decisions that deliver value in tangible ways to our clients. Our clients ask for us on projects that require a superior combination of technical and business capabilities, people and management skills, and a collaborative mindset. We excel in understanding complex programs and strategic initiatives and breaking them into actionable pieces.

We work across a variety of industries and business functions and provide depth and breadth of experience across a set of core capabilities:

- Strategy and Execution – Leverage quantitative and qualitative insights to inform strategic alignment, develop roadmaps, and define prioritization
- Process Improvement - Work with decision-makers to understand organizational goals, process gaps, and make and implement recommendations
- Operational Transformation - Leverage data-based strategies to define organizational goals, identify performance gaps, advise on closing gaps, predict future demand, and lead transformation initiatives
- Organizational Design – Ensure effective alignment of skills and responsibilities, spans and layers, governance, and communication across an organization
- Mergers and Acquisitions – work with organizations to identify, plan, and lead post M&A integration activities.

We close gaps to create unparalleled opportunities for innovation.  We develop and execute strategic blueprints, facilitate, and lead large-scale transformations, and increase operational effectiveness with an approach centered on agility and collaboration.  Our goal is simple: to position our clients as leaders within their sectors.  

The ideal candidate’s experience may include but is not limited to the following:

- Have experience understanding and solving real business problems
- Have experience with presenting business case and strategy to the C-Suite
- Have experience in conducting assessments in different areas that allow organizations a map of where they are and where they may want to go
- Identifying and addressing root causes of operational and strategic issues in organizational and governance structures.

- Been a part of standing up a post merger Integration Management Office and worked leading activities related to 2 organizations coming together

A career at SEI extends well beyond providing great service and thought leadership to our clients. Everyone takes an active role in building and managing our business, in an environment that runs counter to traditional consulting firms. Our consultants have a “seat at the table” and contribute to growing our business in ways that align to their interests such as growing business development opportunities, conducting interviews to support our hiring process, managing internal initiatives that build our brand or organizing trainings to share what you know with your colleagues. There is no telling what an SEI Consultant will be asked to do on a day-to-day basis – we do what it takes to get the job done.
