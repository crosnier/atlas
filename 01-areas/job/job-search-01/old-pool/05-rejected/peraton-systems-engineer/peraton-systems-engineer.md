## 📓 Notes






Splunk -- primary software used to consume data / alerting / security threat info 

Splunk is a technology platform designed for searching, monitoring, and analyzing machine-generated big data through a web-style interface. It helps organizations collect, index, and make sense of massive amounts of machine data from various sources, including servers, applications, and devices. This data can then be used to gain insights into system performance, security events, and operational efficiency.

**What the product does:**
- **Data Aggregation:** Splunk ingests data from virtually any source—logs, metrics, and event data from IT infrastructure, applications, and security systems.
- **Indexing and Searching:** Once data is ingested, it’s indexed and can be searched, filtered, and explored in near real-time.
- **Visualization and Reporting:** Splunk’s dashboards and visualizations help users spot trends, detect anomalies, and track key performance indicators.
- **Alerting and Automation:** Splunk can trigger alerts and automate responses when certain conditions are met, helping teams quickly address potential issues.
- **Security and Compliance:** Splunk is commonly used for security information and event management (SIEM), helping organizations identify and mitigate security threats.
  

**Types of teams that use Splunk:**
1. **IT Operations:** To monitor the health and performance of infrastructure, applications, and networks, and to quickly identify and resolve incidents.
2. **DevOps and Development Teams:** To gain visibility into application performance, troubleshoot deployment issues, and ensure smooth continuous delivery pipelines.
3. **Security Teams:** To perform threat detection, incident response, and compliance reporting, often as a central component of a security operations center (SOC).
4. **Business Analysts and Data Scientists:** To extract business insights from machine data, improving operational efficiency and identifying opportunities for optimization.
