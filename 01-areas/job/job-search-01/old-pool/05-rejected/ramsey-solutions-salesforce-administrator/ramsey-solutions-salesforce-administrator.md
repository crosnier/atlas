**Where And How You‚Äôd Work  
  
**Ramsey Solutions Headquarters is located just outside of Nashville in Franklin, Tennessee. We value our strong, unified company culture because we believe the best work is done together. That‚Äôs why all of our team members work on-site under the same roof. But work-life balance is also important to us, so we offer flexible work schedules to take the stress out of appointments, family obligations and other needs that may pop up.  
  
While every team member has a designated workspace (with an electronic sit-stand desk), our campus was designed to house a variety of unique work and play zones (e.g., quiet library space, coffee bar/lounge areas, recreational game zone, and outside/patio work and break areas).  
  
**What You‚Äôd Do In This Role  
  
**We are seeking Salesforce Administrator to deliver world class support for our EntreLeadership team, helping to further our mission of giving business owners the tools they need to be successful and further providing hope to others in every walk of life. You will be responsible for automating workflows and staying up to date on the latest trends within Salesforce, all while ensuring data quality and security are top of mind. This person needs to be eager to grow in their craft. Someone who gets excited about taking on new challenges and learning from others in the field.

**

- You have 1+ years of experience as a CRM/ Salesforce Administrator
- You are someone who is detail oriented and data driven
- You are a problem solver and someone who is able to provide the day-to-day support for the team  
      
    

**What Winning Looks Like  
  
**

- Regularly review and optimize existing workflows
- Collaborate with team members to identify automation opportunities
- Customize Salesforce features to align with business requirements
- Stay up to date with Salesforce releases and incorporate new features
- Gather feedback from users and adjust customizations accordingly

**Other Stuff To Know  
  
**We‚Äôre looking for people who are passionate about our mission. This isn‚Äôt just a J-O-B. We experience resistance every day because what we believe is absolutely countercultural. We actually hate debt. We actually cut up our credit cards . . . like, for real. Some of us are still fighting our way out of debt, but we aren‚Äôt going back. If you don‚Äôt know much about Ramsey Solutions and our founder, Dave Ramsey, we encourage you to download the Ramsey Network mobile app and consume our content.  
  
**If Ramsey Solutions sounds like a workplace where you can get excited about Mondays, apply today. We can‚Äôt wait to hear from you!
