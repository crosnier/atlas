# 2 Strategies to Sync Locally Stored Files to Multiple Cloud Providers (macOS)

## üîó Strategy 1: Symlink Configuration

Use symlinks to map a single local folder into multiple cloud sync directories:

```bash
mkdir ~/Documents/SyncMe
ln -s ~/Documents/SyncMe ~/Library/Mobile\ Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/SyncMe
ln -s ~/Documents/SyncMe ~/Google\ Drive/SyncMe
```

**Pros:** Real-time sync to both clouds  
**Cons:** Risk of sync conflict or loop if edited simultaneously from different locations

---

## üîÅ Strategy 2: Use Peer Sync + Scheduled Cloud Sync

1. **SyncThing or Resilio Sync** is used to mirror folders between machines or across users
2. Sync'd folder can then be placed inside a Google Drive or iCloud folder for cloud backup

**Pros:** More robust; handles LAN/WAN; supports versioning  
**Cons:** Requires setup and some system understanding
