**Barry-Wehmiller – Organizational Change Management Specialist – $75,000–$95,000 – onsite/hybrid – CONSIDER**

_Organizational Transformation_

**COMPATIBILITY DETAIL**

You have a **72% compatibility** score for this role. Your resume shows deep experience in change leadership, cross-functional collaboration, system adoption, compliance, and communications, which aligns strongly with the core responsibilities of driving organizational change and training. While the role is written for someone with just 1–3 years of direct OCM experience, your senior-level background significantly exceeds that requirement. The key challenge is that this position may be scoped for a more junior practitioner, meaning you are technically overqualified, though your experience would enable you to exceed expectations.

  

**Strengths:**

- Extensive change management and adoption experience in large organizations (ISO/SOX, Salesforce, system integrations).
    
- Strong cross-team facilitation, stakeholder management, and operational strategy alignment.
    
- Proven record in training, communications, and process improvement initiatives.
    

  

**Gaps / Challenges:**

- Job is scoped toward 1–3 years OCM, while your 18+ years may make you appear overqualified.
    
- Some emphasis on manufacturing context, though you’ve worked in technical/ops-heavy environments, not direct plant/manufacturing.
    
- Role may expect hands-on training material creation and delivery, which you’ve overseen but may not have executed personally in recent years.
    

  

**JOB OVERVIEW**

  

**Remote Status**

onsite/hybrid (with 20–25% travel)

  

**Expectations**

In this role, you’ll support organizational transformation initiatives by creating change management plans, training, and communications. You’ll work with cross-functional teams to assess readiness, support stakeholder groups, and build change champion networks. Measuring effectiveness and coordinating training workshops are also core responsibilities.

  

**Department**

Organizational Transformation within Barry-Wehmiller’s consulting and engineering operations, focusing on enabling adoption of new processes, systems, and cultural shifts.

Would you like me to also **recast your senior-level experience** so it looks like a natural fit for a “mid-level” OCM specialist role, making you appear aligned rather than overqualified? That might help if you want to keep this opportunity viable.
