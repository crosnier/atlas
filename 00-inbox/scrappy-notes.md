From Wierz -- Working at DuckDuckGo

I was looking at DDG’s hiring process and they have a prescreen/chat that might give you an opportunity to id the fact that you’re a multi-purpose tool and might be able to fill portions or all of multiple positions.  Being adaptable and having multiple dimensions might be good (it would have for me when I was hiring), or might fail you with a ‘box checker’ initial interview.  You’d have to make a game-time call re: whether your multi-faceted aspects would get you any consideration.
