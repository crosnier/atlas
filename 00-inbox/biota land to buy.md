Barbara would have to subdivide the land in order to sell

Estimated cost ~ $30,000 to $50,000 per acre
assuming 35k/acre x 5 acres = $175,000

### Process:
1.  **Hire a Licensed Land Surveyor:** The landowner must hire a surveyor to create a new plat (a legal map) showing the new property lines. This plat must adhere to Cheatham County's zoning regulations, including minimum lot size and road frontage (typically 50 feet).
2.  **Obtain Septic Approval (if needed):** If the new lot won't have access to public sewer, a soil scientist must perform a soil test. The landowner must then get a septic system permit from the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation (TDEC).
3.  **Submit Application:** The landowner submits the application, plat, and other required documents to the Cheatham County Codes, Building Safety, and Land Use Department.
4.  **Planning Commission Review:** The Cheatham County Planning Commission will review the plat at a monthly meeting. The landowner or their representative must attend this meeting.
5.  **Record the New Plat:** After receiving all necessary approvals and signatures, the new plat is officially recorded with the Cheatham County Register of Deeds, legally creating the new parcels.

### Fees:
* **County Application Fees:**
    * Minor Subdivision Fee: **$150**
    * Archive Fee: **$5**
* **Land Surveyor Fees:** This is the most significant and variable cost. For a two-lot split, expect a range of **$2,500 to $4,500+**, depending on the complexity of the property and the surveyor's rates.
* **Soil Scientist/Septic Fees:** If a soil test and septic permit are needed, this can add **$500 to $1,000+** to the total cost. The TDEC application fee for a new septic system permit is **$400** up to 1000 gallons per day.
* **Register of Deeds Recording Fees:** A small fee is required to officially record the plat.

**Total Estimated Cost (for a straightforward split with septic approval):** **$3,000 to $5,500+**

This estimate is for a simple minor subdivision that doesn't require a variance or new road construction. The process typically takes several months to complete.
