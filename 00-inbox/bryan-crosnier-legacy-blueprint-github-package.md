⚙️ Instructions for Initializing
	1.	Initialize the project (with Vite + React + TypeScript):

npm create vite@latest bryan-portfolio -- --template react-ts
cd bryan-portfolio


	2.	Install TailwindCSS + ShadCN dependencies:

npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p


	3.	Configure tailwind.config.js:

content: ["./index.html", "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}"],


	4.	Add your portfolio code to src/pages/index.tsx
Paste the entire component you’ve built in Canvas here.
	5.	Create README.md:

# Bryan Crosnier - Visual Legacy Portfolio

A React + Tailwind CSS-based portfolio page showcasing my professional legacy, strategic growth, and archetype insights.


	6.	Push to GitHub & enable GitHub Pages (optional):
	•	Set homepage in package.json if deploying
	•	Use gh-pages branch or GitHub Actions to deploy

Let me know if you’d like me to generate all the boilerplate code files directly!
