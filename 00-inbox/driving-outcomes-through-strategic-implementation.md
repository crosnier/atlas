**Slide 6:** **Why It Matters**
**Slide Title:** _Implementation = Execution of Strategy_

- Pull quote box:
    > “Internal projects often mirror external customer engagements. The difference lies in the definition—and the conflict resolution required when definition is lacking.”

- Bullets:    
    - Strategic implementation bridges the gap between idea and value
    - Practical execution delivers stakeholder confidence
    - Strong implementation accelerates time-to-value and adoption
    

**General Formatting Guidance**
- Keep slide text high-level — 5 bullets max per slide, no full paragraphs
- Use bolding or italics for key terms like _integration_, _adoption_, _conflict resolution_
- Use horizontal dividers between sections if on same slide (but favor separation when possible)
- Use icons (e.g. handshake for partnership, gear for integration, lightbulb for strategy)
- Consider highlighting the _dual-role_ nature (external/internal) with a diagram or side-by-side slide

_Implementation pros don’t just unblock projects – they build the roads. 🚧_




✅ Safe, Professional Cross-Platform Fonts

TLDR:
- Font: Arial everywhere for max compatibility
- Title Size: 36+
- Bullet Size: 20–24
- Keep it clean, spaced, and minimal

Font               | Use Case                | Why It Works
------------------ | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------
Arial              | Body + Headings         | Ubiquitous, clean, boring-but-safe
Verdana            | Body Text (alt)         | Extra legible at smaller sizes
Tahoma             | Body Text (alt)         | Modern look, better spacing
Trebuchet MS       | Headings (alt)          | Slightly more stylish
Georgia            | *Optional* for quotes   | Serif, elegant, use sparingly

👉 Avoid `Helvetica Neue`, `Calibri`, or `San Francisco` — they won’t render consistently on both platforms without substitution or font embedding.

🎯 Recommended Font Sizes (Cross-Platform)

Element           | Font          | Size (pt) | Notes
----------------- | ------------- | --------- | ------------------------------
Slide Titles      | Arial Bold    | 36–44     | 1 line max, punchy headline
Section Headers   | Arial Bold    | 28–32     | Can be in ALL CAPS
Bullet Text       | Arial Regular | 20–24     | 5 bullets max per slide
Sub-bullets       | Arial Regular | 18–20     | Use sparingly
Callouts/Quotes   | Georgia Italic | 18–22    | Optional use

🎨 Design Notes for Compatibility

- White background: ✅ totally fine
- Add subtle gray lines or color bars for polish (don’t rely on transparency)
- Use solid fills, not gradients, to ensure accurate rendering on both OSes
- If using PowerPoint or Keynote, embed fonts or export as PDF for full fidelity


*If Arial had a personality, it’d be the unflappable COO.* 🧊

## My Implementation Experience - Exec Summary Version

Customer-facing Implementation Experience -- Two Types
1. Post Sale Integrations -- responsible for enabling customer integration and adoption of the capabilities represented in either their Letter of Intent or executed contract. 
	1. Leverage baseline knowledge of company's technical capabiltiies, interrogate remaining customer requirements, liason between customer IT and company IT teams on remainingi developement and/or integration requirements, with timelines where relevant. 
	2. Typically outside standard Sales Engineering scope of knowledge or responsibilities.
2. Maintenance / Renewal Support -- engage with customer's User and IT teams based on trigger events, with the goal of bidiretionally refreshing undersatnding of both Customer's system and human workflow needs and Company's evolving capabilities.
	1. Function as intermediary between Company's and Customer's IT teams. Extract latest customer flows and provide recommendations for how Company's capabilities can/should be best utilized.  Often facilitating workshops to work through challenges before they become revenue impacting roadblocks.

Company-Internal 
1. Leveraging objective details to build out technical requirements, ensuring end user workflows and adoption strategies are appropriately accounted for within the technical scope mandates and roadmap.  
	1. to gather requirements, design technical implementation scope with Product Owners, collaborate on technical roadmaps, facilitate user beta programs where appropriate, collaborate with customer's technical teams, and facilitate user training and adoption activities. 

> Internal projects are often no different than external customer engagements, at their core. They just sometimes come with the implication of less rigid guardrails or definition, which can result in more conflict resolution opportunities.  This is where a well-versed implementation specialist can cut through the noise to bring practical value and progress.

## Narrative - My Implementation Experience

I've been responsible, or placed in the facilitator seat, for a variety of complex implementation challenges.  
      
For external customers, I've had a couple categories of implementation projects.  
      
Post Sale integrations --  
Sales or Sales Engineers tapped me in to work through how to enable and integrate the product, platform, or tools sold to the customer. This entailed leveraging the, often limited, requirements from the Sales team as the launch point to interrogate and document all necessary requirements for both internal and external technical teams to 'onboard' the customer systems.  
      
I can elaborate further on both flavors of integrating customer human or system workflows into 'our' technology, and to integrate 'our' technology into the customer's environment.  In either scenario, I served as intermediary - ensuring I understood both our and customer's system requirements and guardrails to connect the dots on how to most effectively implement the product/platform/tech resulting in the customer getting up and running.  
      
i.e. web-based services, platform integrations by way of locally installed tools with auth into host services, entirely selfhosted UI enabling callouts to our services alongside 3rd party sources.  
      

Internal Implementations  

Leveraging objective details, both vague and detailed scope, to gather requirements, design technical implementation scope, embedding myself with dev and user teams to ensure rapid and accurate early prototype validation, and ultimately serving as liaison between Dev and 'User' teams to minimize language barrier challenges while Project Managing feature and story-level execution.  
    
A couple internal projects also required External customer participation to thoughtfully vet the capabilities for products OR UIs that would ultimately be externally exposed 2-4 years in the future. I scoped, organized, facilitated and managed output from a full Beta program with top tier customers.(Edited)
    
Might be far more verbose than you were gunning for - wanted to be sure the breadth and depth was clear. 


...suffice to say I've played multiple roles from Sales Engineer and Technical Account Mgr to DevOps and even Developer.  My happy place has always been with the Implementation related responsibilities -- figuring out how to best translate user needs into actionable requirements and an implementation roadmap that makes sense.  
      
saying that reminded me...One of my big wins at Maxar was my being the sole party that found a way to solve the major communication problem between Dev Train implementation plans and (Internal/External) User Adoption gaps that would've tanked a large part of the Commercial business if left unaddressed.  

My efforts to define and socialize the challenges with exec leadership, along with recommended solutions, ultimately formed a multi-million dollar fully staffed initiative that is on year 3 and due to come to a close in Q1 2026.(Edited)




Yikes - i know better than to rapidly brain dump on a whim. I dropped what i was doing to bolt to my computer and didn't pause first - became a little verbose.
