# Educational Information Relevant to Professional Life

AI-related tools, methodoogyies and resources relevant to increaseing "AI" knowledge for career progression.


## IT / Cyber Security



Here’s a concise list of relevant tools and technologies to learn so you can confidently perform this part of the role:
⸻

🔧 AI/ML & NLP Tools
	•	spaCy – Industrial-strength NLP toolkit for tagging, parsing, etc.
	•	Hugging Face Transformers – Pretrained models for text classification, tagging, summarization
	•	scikit-learn – Basic ML: clustering, classification, vectorization
	•	NLTK – Lightweight NLP tasks (tokenization, stemming, etc.)
	•	OpenAI APIs – For leveraging GPT models to auto-categorize or summarize content
	•	LangChain – Framework for building LLM-driven workflows (e.g., content classification)

⸻

📊 Metadata & Taxonomy Platforms
	•	PoolParty – Professional taxonomy/ontology management
	•	TopQuadrant – Metadata modeling and knowledge graph tools
	•	Neo4j – Graph database useful for hierarchical or semantic relationships
	•	ElasticSearch + ML plugins – For content tagging, semantic search, anomaly detection

⸻

☁️ Cloud-Based AI Services (Low-Code/No-Code)
	•	Azure Cognitive Services – Text analytics, classification, entity extraction
	•	Google Cloud AutoML – Train custom models with minimal code
	•	AWS Comprehend – NLP and classification at scale

⸻

🛠️ Supporting Tools
	•	Labelbox / Prodigy – For training/labeling datasets
	•	DVC or MLflow – (optional) for managing datasets or ML workflows
	•	Jupyter Notebooks – For prototyping and testing ML/NLP models

⸻

This stack lets you go from “I know what this model is doing” to “I can prototype or collaborate intelligently on taxonomy automation.”
“Know the tools, run the tags, rule the chaos.” 🧠📚
