# A Guide to Emotional Hygiene for Over-thinkers

Overthinking isn’t clarity—it’s emotional clutter. Emotional hygiene means catching the mental mess _before_ it overwhelms. It’s about maintenance, not mastery. You don’t need to fix everything—just clear enough to breathe, feel, and not spiral.

### **🧼 Key Emotional Hygiene Practices
🪞 **Recognize Overthinking Early**
    Catch spirals before they start. Name overwhelm, not yourself.
    
🛑 **Interrupt the Loop Gently**
    Don’t analyze—create space instead of seeking answers.
    
🧍 **Check In With Your Body*    
    Ask: Am I tired or activated? Do I need rest?
    
✍️ **Write Down the Thought**
    Let it sit 24 hours before acting on it.
    
🌿 **Step Outside Without Your Phone**
    Reduce stimulation and give your mind space.
    
🚰 **Drink Water Before Reacting**
    Literally hydrate before you ruminate.
    
☎️ **Call Someone**
    Reach out when you feel like isolating.
   
🌙 **Honor Simple Routines**
    Go to bed on time. Wake up to check capacity, not productivity.
    
🧠 **Don’t Believe Every Thought**
    Thoughts visit—you don’t have to live in them.
  
🔁 **Soft Reset When You Forget**
    No guilt. Just say, “That’s enough for today.”
