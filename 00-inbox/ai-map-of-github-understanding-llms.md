# AI Map of Github : Understanding LLMs

**Limits, Memory, and the Agent Mindset**

**Summary of Presentation**  
The presentation compared large language models (LLMs) to humans with unique cognitive traits, emphasizing their limitations and design considerations.  
- **Metaphors for Understanding LLMs**:  
  - "LLMs are like an autistic adult" – highlighting intense focus on literal details and struggles with implicit context.  
  - "LLMs have anterograde amnesia" – meaning they cannot retain information beyond their set context window without explicit storage.  
- **Context Windows**: Framed as the LLM’s “working memory,” crucial for maintaining coherence and task continuity.  
- **AI Agents Concept**: Described as “people spirits,” or human-like computers capable of executing actions autonomously.  

**Highlights**  
- Direct analogies used to clarify LLM cognitive limits.  
- Strong emphasis on context window size as a key factor in capability.  
- Framing AI agents as action-performing entities with human-like operational styles.
