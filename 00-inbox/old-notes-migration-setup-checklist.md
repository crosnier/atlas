Here’s your full reset checklist, clean and in proper order.
This will migrate your notes from Obsidian → raw Markdown → GitHub → VSCode workflows.
Git commands included, assuming you want to stay in VSCode terminal as much as possible.

🛠️ Full Migration + Setup Checklist (High Level)

# Obsidian to GitHub Markdown Repo Migration Checklist

## 1. Prepare Local Files
- [x] Identify the Obsidian vault(s) you want to migrate.
- [x] Copy all `.md` notes and attachments to a staging folder outside Obsidian.
- [x] Remove `.obsidian/` folder and any plugin/config junk.
- [ ] Organize notes into clean folder structure:
  - Main categories (`job-search-2025`, `homelab`, etc.)
  - Create a `-images/` folder at the root for attachments.
- [ ] OPTIONAL: Clean or update internal links (`[[wiki-links]]`) to `[Markdown](links)` if needed.

## 2. Create GitHub Repo
- [ ] Go to GitHub → Create a new **private** repository.
- [ ] **Do NOT** initialize with README (you'll push local files).

## 3. Clone Repo Locally (VSCode Terminal)
- [ ] Open Terminal inside VSCode.
- [ ] Clone empty repo:
  ```bash
  git clone git@github.com:your-username/your-repo-name.git

	•	cd into your new repo folder:

cd your-repo-name



4. Move Local Notes into Repo
	•	Copy your cleaned notes and folders into the cloned repo directory.
	•	Verify folder structure looks correct inside VSCode Explorer.

5. Prepare Supporting Files
	•	Create a simple README.md explaining the project.
	•	Create a .gitignore file:

.DS_Store
.vscode/
*.log
*.tmp



6. Stage, Commit, and Push to GitHub (VSCode Terminal)
	•	Stage all changes:

git add .


	•	Commit with a good message:

git commit -m "Initial migration from Obsidian to structured markdown"


	•	Push to GitHub:

git push origin main



7. Set Up GitHub Project Board (Optional but Recommended)
	•	Go to your repo → Projects → New Project.
	•	Create basic columns: To Do, In Progress, Done.
	•	Track tasks, enhancements, cleanup work there.

8. Final VSCode Setup Tweaks (Optional but Smart)
	•	Install VSCode extensions:
	•	Markdown All in One
	•	GitLens
	•	Project Manager (optional)
	•	Configure VSCode settings for autosave and visible file explorer refresh.

| Phase            | Action                                          |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Prep**         | Clean up Obsidian files                         |
| **GitHub**       | Create empty private repo                       |
| **VSCode**       | Clone repo → Move notes → Stage, Commit, Push   |
| **GitHub Projects** | Create board, manage tasks if needed        |
| **(Optional)**   | Final polish: Extensions, settings in VSCode    |

---

# 🚀 Bonus Tip
**You can do *everything* here directly inside VSCode terminal and Explorer.**  
No need for separate GitHub Desktop or external apps once you're set.

---

# 🧠 Final Reminder:
> **Don't move too much at once.**  
> Migrate ONE project folder first (`job-search-2025`), validate it works, THEN migrate the next (`homelab`, etc).

“If your folder tree needs a chainsaw, you’re doing it right.”

Here’s my blunt, tactical recommendation based on what you shared:

⸻

🎯 Overall Repo Reorganization Plan

✅ 1 GitHub Repo = 1 Major Project Area

GitHub Repo Name	Contents
job-search-2025	All job-search-2025 folder contents + related assets
homelab-notes	homelab/, automation-*, any homelab-related code
daily-life-notes	daily-life/ minus homelab + gaming + code-projects
gaming-projects	gaming/ folder from daily-life (Minecraft stuff etc)
learning-vault	learning/ (GPT usage, optimization, tutorials)
media-assets	Separate repo if you want or just a shared -images folder inside each repo



⸻

🪓 Specific Action Moves
	•	Delete or Archive the vault-template/ junk unless you actually use it. It’s redundant.
	•	Split daily-life into:
	•	life/ ➔ goes into daily-life-notes
	•	homelab/ ➔ goes into homelab-notes
	•	gaming/ ➔ goes into gaming-projects
	•	learning/ ➔ goes into learning-vault
	•	code-projects/ ➔ your call: either inside homelab-notes or eventually new repo like code-experiments
	•	Drop all _attachments/ into a folder called -images/ at repo root for each repo.
	•	Move templates into /_templates/ subfolders in each repo if needed.
	•	Standardize naming: kebab-case everything for folder and file names.

⚡ Example New Structure: job-search-2025 Repo

/job-search-2025
  |- 01-jobs/
  |- 02-applications/
  |- outreach-and-networking/
  |- research/
  |- resume-and-cover-letters/
  |- _templates/
  |- _logs/
  |- -images/
  |- index.md
  |- README.md



⸻

🛠 GitHub Projects Setup Recommendation
	•	Create one Project Board per repo.
	•	Call it something clean like:
	•	Job Search Tracker
	•	Homelab Roadmap
	•	Learning Development
	•	Columns:
	•	📥 Inbox
	•	✏️ In Progress
	•	✅ Completed
	•	📚 Backlog (future ideas)

⸻

🧹 Cleanup Rules

Old Item	New Plan
_attachments/	Rename to -images/ and move to root
_config/, _logs/	Keep if valuable. Otherwise nuke.
vault-template/	Delete unless absolutely needed
.canvas files	Ignore or archive; not portable Markdown
.md.md typo files	Fix or delete
Random .png/.jpg scattered	Consolidate inside -images/



⸻

🧢 Quick Pro-Tips
	•	Start simple, expand later. Don’t over-template upfront.
	•	Folder = Context, Markdown File = Content.
	•	Push your repos even half-baked. Git history = your safety net.
	•	Each repo README.md should explain:
	•	Purpose of the notes
	•	How to contribute or expand it later
	•	Basic file structure

Want me to generate a template repo structure you can clone and use instantly for each project?
(Example: empty folders + empty README.md + empty -images/ folder, ready to roll.) 🚀
Would save you a lot of time. ✅
