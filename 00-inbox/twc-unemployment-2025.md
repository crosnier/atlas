## Eligibility Info

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Wait Until Severance Ends to Collect Unemployment!**
> Because your severance is being paid out as bi-weekly checks, the Texas Workforce Commission (TWC) treats that period as continued employment/pay, even if you‚Äôre not working.

üîç Breakdown:  
- Your 20-week severance delays your unemployment for 20 weeks from March 3, 2025
  - *That pushes your first eligible claim week to around July 21, 2025*
- TWC will disqualify benefit payments during weeks you‚Äôre receiving severance in check form
  - *This is true even if you file and certify ‚Äî they‚Äôll just mark you ineligible for payment*

---

‚úÖ What You Should Do Now:

Action	When
- File claim (‚úÖ done): June 6, 2025
- Start tracking work search: Week of July 21 (first eligible week)
- First payment request date: Tuesday, August 5, 2025 (covering July 21‚ÄìAug 3)

Track final severance paycheck :: Due week of July 14
Begin tracking job searches :: Starting week of July 21
File first payment request :: Tuesday, August 5

‚úÖ **You log job search activities weekly** (minimum **3 per week**)
‚úÖ **You submit your payment request every 2 weeks**

---

üß† Activity Behaviour

| **Action**            | **Frequency**        |
| --------------------- | -------------------- |
| Track job searches    | **Weekly** (min 3)   |
| Request payment       | **Every 2 weeks**    |
| Submit job search log | **Only if TWC asks** |
_‚ÄúThink of it like taxes ‚Äî record everything, submit just enough.‚Äù_

üí° Pro Tip:

## Terminating TWC Unemployment Benefits -- Got A Job!!!

üß† ‚ÄúGet a job? Time to clock out of benefits the right way.‚Äù

‚∏ª

‚úÖ What Getting a Job Means for Unemployment Benefits in Texas:

Once you‚Äôre re-employed, you must report that change immediately to the TWC to avoid overpayment (which they will reclaim üí∏).

‚∏ª

üîß Required Actions:

1. Stop Submitting Payment Requests
	‚Ä¢	Do not file a payment request for any weeks worked full-time.
	‚Ä¢	If you already submitted for a week and then got hired, still report the wages on your next request (or contact TWC to correct).

2. Report New Job Info to TWC

There are two ways:

üñ• Online via TWC UI Portal:
	‚Ä¢	Go to: https://www.twc.texas.gov
	‚Ä¢	Log into your unemployment account
	‚Ä¢	Look for ‚ÄúReport Return to Work‚Äù or update in the weekly payment request form

üìû Or Call:
	‚Ä¢	TWC Tele-Center: 1-800-939-6631
	‚Ä¢	Wait times suck‚Äîearly mornings work best

‚∏ª

üßæ Info You‚Äôll Need to Report:
	‚Ä¢	Employer name
	‚Ä¢	Start date
	‚Ä¢	Type of work (full-time, part-time, contract, etc.)
	‚Ä¢	Estimated earnings (especially for partial work weeks)

‚∏ª

‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes:
	‚Ä¢	If you earn over 125% of your weekly benefit, you won‚Äôt receive a payout for that week.
	‚Ä¢	Failure to report = fraud = possible fines, repayment, or legal action.
