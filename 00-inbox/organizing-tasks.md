# Organizing My Tasks

## Wearing Multiple Hats

I tend to aggressively compartmentalize much of life -- this extends into my task management principles across both daily life and my career. I divide up my workload based on the 'hat' I must wear to execute it. Typically, when I put on a specific hat, I hone into that area of thought until predefined exit criteria is met which triggers me to switch to a different hat. The better I can allocated focused time to a specific hat, the more effective I can be. 

The most common tool-based implementation of a 'hat' is a 'project'. Leveraging projects to segment the hats has been one of the most effective mechanisms. 

> *Takeaways: 
> 	1. 'Hat' = area of thought typically requiring a specific line of thought and focus
> 	2. Hat == Project (in most tools)*

**Projects I Use**
- life - anything progressing daily life - health, financial, personal relationships, etc.
- techy - everyday tech-related tasks and logistics requiring 'tech hat', which may enable or serve other projects but typically stand alone. 
	- *Easiest for me to get lost in wearing this hat*
- homelab - tasks related to the maturation or changes to my homelab infrastructure and services
- job - anything related to my career progression or job search activities
- coding - coding project work
- tactfully0 - tasks related to my Tactfully Offensive business

## Implementation

This content is predominantly focused on the Task Management implementation detail, though I've referenced a couple other related tools that ultimately feed my task backlog.

**Latest Tooling**
- Thought Organization *(mind mapping)* = Freeform 
- Concept Planning *(typically in collaboration with others)* = Trello boards
- Task Management = ToDoIst

**Task Lifecycle**
Thought > Concept > Task 

>Tasks usually originate from a Project when the scope of work is provided externally. Otherwise, my Concept is broken down directly into executable Tasks. The Project then serves to associate those Tasks with the appropriate Hat.


### Discovering Project Structure
I've taken to using the following crude template to interrogate how to best structure each project into my task management tool. Bringing answers to these details into a discovery conversation may result in a pretty good initial implementation. 

**Project Name:**  
*A clear, short name for the project.*

**High-Level Goal or Mission:**  
*What is this project trying to accomplish?*

**Types of Tasks Involved:**  
*Briefly list task types (e.g., writing, coding, outreach, research).*

**Any Repeating Workflows or Routines?:**  
*Yes/No — If yes, describe what repeats and how often.*

**Need for Collaboration?:**  
*Yes/No — If yes, with whom and how? (e.g., shared workspace, comments)*

**Preferred View Mode:**  
*Board or List (Kanban vs classic list view)?*

**Anything Else to Consider?:**  
*Info on urgency, timelines, blockers, or tools used with this project.*


> *Important: Refine the implementation as you learn what's best for you to be effective!*


### Breaking Down Projects Into Tasks 

Different projects may warrant different segmentation / categories or labels. All tasks must be consistent across projects - after all, I'm 1 human wearing multiple hats. The more the tool works for me the easier life will be.  I'll put a lot of effort into building a processing and tooling once, then it has to work for me or I won't use it for long. 

#### Sections or Categories
Some projects warrant kanban style progression, others may need sub-division of like tasks that fall into a similar theme or sub-category within that hat's skillset or line of thought.

##### my kanban
*Research > Backlog > Staging > ToDo > Doing > Limbo > Done*

Research
*investigation required to identify or define task scope*

Backlog
*scoped work that should eventually be refined and prioritized for work*

Staging
*scoped and prioritized by stack-ranking*

ToDo
*planned and prioritized - typically a queue for the next iteration of work*

Doing
*actively working*

Limbo
*blocked or stalled work not immediately able to be resolved within current iteration*

Done
*completed work - in most tools this is a status and not a category*

##### other type?


#### Priority

#### Status
A rigid indicator of progress. Most tools leverage near identical status values. 

> Note: I'm not a fan of custom status values.

#### Labels
the flagging of tasks with relevant indicators that help provide at-a-glance understanding of the task amidst the overall workload
