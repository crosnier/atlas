RE: Level of Focus - how work jacked personal life task focus

Amongst some other practical things, I came to realize one of my 'functional' challenges that's been causing issues. 

I've been pushed into so aggressively context switching and juggling many things simultaneously for so long that I essentially adapting my brain function as a matter of survival at work. Radical adaptation, so to speak.  This does NOT translate to normal project effectiveness in the rest of life.  

My predisposition to compartemntalize and do many things requires focused balance - times where i slow down to thoughtfully construct something, methodically break it down and execute, then complete and move to the next project. You know...what 'normal' people probably do when focusing on one thing at a time. 

Anyway, realized that the semi-frantic jobless psychological state can be nearly identical to the high-pressure mutiple project juggling directives which triggers a default corporate fight or flight state that inherently blocks me from the slower mono-focused effort.
