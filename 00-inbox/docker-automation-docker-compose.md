# docker automation using docker compose

Attack Plan
1. docker-compose yamls for all existing services    
2. validate on rapberry pi
3. store yamls and instruction in github

What is Infrastructure as Code (IaC)?

At the highest level:
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) = managing servers, services, networks, containers with config files instead of clicking GUIs or manually running commands.

```
•	Everything is declared in code (YAML, JSON, etc.)
•	You store config in Git or other version control
•	Changes = commit/push, not click/save
•	Servers read config → apply the desired state automatically
```

In practice:  
Instead of clicking buttons in Unraid’s Docker tab, you’d define all those containers in a docker-compose.yml file.

That file becomes the “truth” of your environment.

---

Why it’s powerful:

✅ Easier backups (your infra is just files)  
✅ Instant rebuilds on new hardware (run a single command)  
✅ Rollbacks = git revert  
✅ Easy automation + scaling

---

Your progression: From Unraid GUI → IaC workflow

1. Current: Unraid GUI Docker Management  
    • Click “Add Container”  
    • Fill image, ports, volumes, env vars  
    • Hit “Apply”  
    • Manual updates (click Update button per container)
    

LIMITATIONS:  
• Not easily portable  
• Not version-controlled  
• Tedious for >5 containers

---

1. Next step: Docker Compose
    

You define containers in a docker-compose.yml:

version: "3"

services:  
myapp:  
image: myapp:latest  
ports:  
- "8080:80"  
environment:  
- MYVAR=value  
volumes:  
- /data:/app/data

Then instead of clicking buttons:

docker compose up -d

→ All containers spin up as defined, same every time.

Update something?  
→ Change YAML → docker compose up -d applies updates.

---

1. Automating with Git (Infrastructure as Code)    

Now store that docker-compose.yml in GitHub or GitLab.

Your workflow becomes:  
1. Edit YAML in Git  
2. Commit → push to main branch  
3. Your server auto-pulls → runs docker compose up -d

This pipeline = automated deploys via Git.

Any config change is traceable, reviewable, revertable.

---

1. Bonus: Adding Renovate, CI/CD, Webhooks
To make it “radically automated”:  
• Add Renovate Bot → opens PRs to update image versions  
• You review PR → merge  
• GitHub webhook triggers server to pull latest + redeploy

Boom:

Renovate PR → you merge → server redeploys automatically

No SSH, no manual docker pull, no clicking “Update” in Unraid GUI.

---

Why it’s a radical improvement:

✅ No more clicking around UIs  
✅ Config is version-controlled  
✅ Automated updates, with review  
✅ Rebuilding server is just git clone + docker compose up  
✅ Dev/prod parity (runs the same everywhere)

---

🔥 Quick roadmap for you:  
1. Export/replicate Unraid containers into a docker-compose.yml  
2. Move that file into a Git repo  
3. Run docker compose up -d on server instead of using Unraid GUI  
4. Add Renovate Bot for updates  
5. Add Webhook or cron pull script to auto-redeploy after Git push  
6. Optional: retire Unraid’s Docker tab for direct Compose management

---

Big takeaway:
Right now Unraid’s GUI is imperative (click → do)
Docker Compose + Git becomes declarative (this file = desired state → system applies it)
That’s Infrastructure as Code in action.
