Application for **Lead, Business Process Improvement**

Dear Airbnb Hiring Team,

I’m excited to apply for the Lead, Business Process Improvement role at Airbnb. With over a decade of experience driving business process transformation, customer operations strategy, and scaling service delivery through technology implementation and human workflow optimization, I’m confident in my ability to make a meaningful impact on Airbnb’s Community Support organization.

Most recently, as a Senior Staff Operations Strategist at Maxar Technologies, I led multiple end-to-end process improvement initiatives across customer support, product, and engineering—delivering measurable improvements across global operations. I’ve built and scaled Tier 1–3 support models, established KPI frameworks, and designed workforce strategies that balanced efficiency with customer experience—all through deep collaboration with stakeholders across Sales, Product, Program Management, and Operations.

My background includes extensive experience analyzing customer journey pain points, developing scalable solutions, and launching new operating models. I’ve led initiatives to optimize tools and processes while bringing structure to ambiguity. Though I don't hold a formal Lean Six Sigma certification, I’ve applied its core principles across multiple enterprise-level transformations to achieve lasting impact.

I’m passionate about building systems that streamline workflows and improve the customer experience—characteristics critical to the success of this role.  I look forward to bringing that focus and solution-oriented approach to Airbnb’s Community Support organization.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to Airbnb’s continued success and innovation.

Sincerely, 

Bryan Crosnier
