## 4. My Signature Superpowers

### 🛠️ Superpower: Seamless Strategic-Technical Bridge  
**Manifestation & Value:**  
I deconstruct silos between strategy, systems, and support—translating technical constraints into operational workflows that *actually work*. From mission-critical voice nets to Salesforce ecosystems, I don’t just plan—I embed, adapt, and elevate.

### 🔄 Superpower: Adaptive Multi-Context Leadership  
**Manifestation & Value:**  
Whether as strategist, DevOps engineer, or transitional operator, I fill the gaps that others leave behind. I step into ambiguity, adapt rapidly, and deliver results across technical, operational, and human contexts—always returning systems to a state of balance and clarity.
