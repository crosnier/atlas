short version - it's not that i'm super 'down', seems i haven't yet reconciled on wehre/how i'm focused.

current anxiety triggers, to name the few most prevelent:
- no job...crap...
- job i was doing isn't actually a 'thing'
- shoot, one of my kids wo'nt learn basic life skills...need to make him do 'x' today.
- shouldn't i use this opportunity to radically change something / jobs?
- no, get A job over $xx...must have funds, then change later
- culling hundreds of listings
- social interactions are more difficult than i remember
- this is what retirement probably feels like, how do i get to this...CRAP no retirement savings - get a JOB
- can i create something that can make money? let's try a couple thigns.
