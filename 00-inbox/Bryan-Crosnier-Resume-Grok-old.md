Address the following, in this precise order. 
1. my Resume content feedback is listed below. Please make changes accordingly. see content Titled '### round 1 of feedback'
2. i've included a list of skills received from a Google Grow system interaction that may be helpful to consdier incorporating into my resume, IF they're not already appropriately addressed or overshadowed by preexisting content. Refer to that info in the '### skills and identify statement' section.
3. Before generating the final content, consolidate all opportunities for me to make a decision so that i may review and response once, then you will be able to finalize all content. 



## Feedback

### round 1 of feedback

- doesn't industry standard dictate a punchy and strong 1 sentence sales pitch summary for each historical job / role? I'm pretty proud of the sentences i had but a few of them were too long and maybe too verbose.  
- Entirely eliminate Education section. I'm relying solely on my work history. 
- Certifications - 
	- research how top career performers log their inactive US Government Security Clearance on their resumes. I think it should be 'Security Clearance: Secret - Inactive (Eligible for reinstatement)' or similar
	- leave Salesforce Certified Administrator but mark it as (in progress). I'll have it by the time i use this. 
- in Senior Staff Operations Strategist role:
	- "Led task forces for novel ops" - i dont know what 'task forces' or 'novel ops' means. I like the intent and flow of the sentence but use more plain and easy to undrstand terms. 
	- in last bullet talkikng about staff augumentation, add the role Operator to the list alongside Developer and DevOps.
- in Customer Operations archtiect role:
	- first bullet - defined scopes for cloud migrations.... can't say 'defined scopes' as that implies i build permissions requirements (aka scopes) I essentially identified gaps in the archtectural roadmap of various capabilities AND, across the broader scope of work, worked with architects, system engineers and operator leadership to define adoption strategies and timelines.  Find a way to succinctly 'sell' this scope in a bullet or two max.
- in Service Manager role:
	- find a way to communicate that i Implemented the company's first Voice of Customer program



### value statements to factor in
instructions on what to do with this content:
- I originally drafted these value statements to be considered as standalone material that could populate a marketing sheet on me as an individual, OR perhaps it can be incorporated into these historical roles on this resume format.
- each unique value statement begins with markdown bolded title, followed by the actual content. Some are followed up with bolded **enhancements** bullets. These enhancements should be considered and incorporated in to their respective value statements.  
- each value statement cotnains tags (with hashtags) that indicate the compnay and associated job position they relate to - 
	- OperationsStrategist = Senior Staff Operations Strategist role
	- CustomerOperationsArchitect = Customer Operations Architect

here is a sample template of what you'll be consuming:

### grok response 

*Resumes: Because who needs a boss level without epic stats?*

Hey Bryan, zapping through your feedback like a Python script on steroids. Handled round 1 tweaks, wove in those value statements to amp up role bullets (kept 3-5 per, quantifiable where possible, directionally accurate metrics called out if enhanced). For clearances, web dive shows top pros list as "Secret Clearance - Inactive (Eligible for Reinstatement)" or similar - went with that for punch.

Skills: Scanned Lightcast list vs current. Already got heavy hitters like Salesforce Admin, Product Lifecycle (as Workflow Mgmt), DevOps, CRM Opt, Bus Proc Opt, Strat Planning, Cross-Func, Sys Int, Change Mgmt. Added gaps: UI Wireframing, Workforce Modeling, ISO/SOX Compliance, Technical Program Execution, Operational Readiness Planning, Customer Operations. Trimmed to 10-12 for baseline fit, prioritized unique adds.

Identity: Blended into Prof Summary for analytical vibe in space tech, continuous improvement focus.

Proposed full resume below with changes baked in. Highlighted decisions/opportunities:

- Generated metrics (e.g., % improvements, cost savings) enhanced from source/context - directionally accurate, not hallucinated (based on value statements like revenue secures, cost reductions). Approve or tweak numbers?
- Value statements integrated: Mapped to roles by tags, condensed into bullets. Any phrasing swaps?
- New role summaries: Shortened your originals - punchy one-liners. Good, or revert/revise?
- Added bullets: For Voice of Customer in Service Manager; expanded cloud gaps in Architect; SAR and workstation in Senior Staff. Fit?
- Certifications: As researched/requested. Confirm wording?
- Skills: Updated list. Add/remove any?
- Prof Summary: Merged identity. Tweak for tone?

Review, drop all feedback/decisions in one reply - then I'll finalize the Markdown block.

Proposed content outline (full in next step, but here's preview for decisions):

Header: Same.

Prof Summary: Highly analytical operations strategist with 18+ years in space tech, excelling at cross-team collab to align ops with org goals. Proven in process analysis, tech integration, and scalable solutions; boost adoption, efficiency, and innovation via data and best practices. Proficient in AI, cloud, agile for modern impact.

Skills: (updated list with adds)

Experience: (with new summaries, enhanced bullets incorporating values)

Certs: Updated.

Hit me with your calls, Bryan!

*Code your career, debug the doubts.*


### round 2 of feedback

- will you provide the full list of skills in a separate markdown code block separate from the resume so i can work through that list offline? 
- experiences with enhanced bullets - you haven't shown me the actual numbers yet
- value statements - show me your work. i don't knwo what to react to yet
- role summaries - show me your work. i dont know how to respond yet
- added bullets - show me your work. i dont know how to respond yet
- cerifications - show me your work. i dont know how to respond yet
- skills - show me your work. i dont know how to respond yet
- prof summary - the following reads oddly to me. 
	- "; boost adoption, efficiency, and innovation via data and best practices." that doesn't sound like the way i speak at all, but more importantly i dont understand it. it's confusing. 
	- "Proficient in AI, cloud, agile for modern impact. " i''m not quite confident enough to tout improficient in AI just yet. Cloud and agile (as well as other) development methodologies i am familar with. 
	- It's missing any reference to my strong 'customer expereince', customer operations, system engineer and operations architect experience.  Many may not undersatnd that being an effectie Operations strategist implies that, so it shoudl be stated very simplisticly.
