# Building a GPT Mastery Course, Using GPT
The objective is to have GPT generate it's own educated prompts that ultimately creates a full GPT Prompt education course.

## Course Outline Generation Prompt
As 'part 1' of a 2 part prompt, this guides GPT into generating the course outline.  

Instruction to have GPT generate the course content:  
```markdown
Build an extremely effective and thorough prompt to instruct GPT on how to act as an instructor - providing a fairly aggressive and succinct course teaching a user how to most effecrively leverage GPT and its models. 

Start with the basics of customization, prompting principles, definition of healthy and unhealthy prompts, how a human should compartementalize topics in chats vs across chats etc.

Spend only the amount of time necessary focused on the beginner basics and bias more towards the moderate to advance user instruction once the core competencies are addressed. 

Additional attributes:
- include examples in code block form - easy to identify, consume and copy/paste. 
- Have a clear agenda and identifiers for each section, sub-section, topic
- ideally generate the output into a single large markdown file to download
- visuals where logical to expedite learning that would otherwise require more verbiage to accomplish the same. 
- include some playful quips or creative stories to convey points and make the learning more practical and easy to understand. 
```

Choose one of the following course outlines:  
- [Mastery Course Prompt - Combat Mode](./gpt-prompt-course-mastery-combat-mode.md)  
- [Mastery Course Prompt - Aggressive Mode](./gpt-prompt-course-mastery-aggressive-mode.md)
