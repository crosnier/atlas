**Summary of the Article**
The article discusses a resident of Elkton, Maryland, Debbie Blankenship, who has experienced a series of personal tragedies, including the death of her dogs due to cancer and her own cancer diagnosis. The community is concerned about the presence of "forever chemicals" in their water supply, which is a concern for many residents, particularly those who have experienced health issues.

**What are "Forever Chemicals"?**
"Forever chemicals," also known as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), are a group of synthetic chemicals that are resistant to heat, water, and oil. They were widely used in various products, including non-stick cookware, food packaging, firefighting foam, and clothing, due to their unique properties.

**Health Risks Associated with PFAS**
Research has linked exposure to PFAS to several health problems, including:
* Cancer (e.g., testicular, kidney, and thyroid cancer)
* Reproductive issues (e.g., low birth weight, birth defects)
* Thyroid disease
* Immune system problems
* High cholesterol

**Contamination of Drinking Water**
PFAS have contaminated drinking water sources in many areas of the United States, including the community in Elkton, Maryland. These chemicals can leach into groundwater through various sources, including:
* Industrial sites
* Firefighting activities
* Landfills
* Manufacturing facilities

**Regulatory Response**
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has set a non-enforceable health advisory level for two types of PFAS: PFOA and PFOS. Some communities have implemented measures to reduce exposure, such as:
* Installing water treatment systems
* Providing alternative water sources
* Conducting public education campaigns

**What Can Residents Do?**
Residents in affected areas can take steps to reduce their exposure to PFAS, including:
* Using alternative water sources
* Installing water filtration systems
* Avoiding products containing PFAS
* Participating in public education campaigns
